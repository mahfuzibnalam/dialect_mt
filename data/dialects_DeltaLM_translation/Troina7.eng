The books who ordered them will not come to them.

If you look at me, those who study, they're happy to go to school.

Don't invite Giorgio and Franco to dinner, but pattiru.

I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Whoever closes the door.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tell them who they are capable of.
Whoever was seen naked.
About who everyone will pass the test.
It's gonna be hot on it.
On who I'll eat, on who I'll starve.
The book I wrote is boring.
I think you're sitting on comfortable tables.
There's three people who listen to you.

I'm up on apple pickers.
Don't be mad.
I know brothers scupriru all cooks.
Chiamaru to Vincenzu.
Tuppuliaru a potta, avissi griessi nuostru patri.
It's not a lot.
I'll call Vincenzo.
All of them.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He who was not promoted was naked.
Samaru Mariu at school.
I tell them, but I'm not going to tell them.
I'll call you a relative I know.
. . .

The woman who cleans the stairs is sick.

Maria, ask who you can't get out of here. He's in Naples.
. . .
Harry, who eats a lot, it's a big deal.
I've seen you before, you know.

My mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother.
Get to the table before grandma arrives.
Let's hope we're done with this without anyone getting tired of it.
Whoever brings quaccadunu, lock the door.
You know who Mario eats, you know who you eat.
Alberto got him.
Iddu, Iddu, Iddu, Iddu.
I didn't want you to come with me.
I'll tell you who's gonna get alive.
Livvu who not come naked.
Tell me who you were.
I'm convinced that Mariu has his own study.
I'm like the guy he called Gianni.
. . .
It's not like you're naked.
I know who quaccunu vuciau.
What's going on?
You know who I said she's threatened. Don't get into situations.
I don't know who said Mariu, it's a crydiry.
. . .
They were talking to Maria in the sack.
I'll take it when it comes.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I don't know who's got dinner.
I'm going to take you out of here. I'm gonna take you out of here.
What did I say, Gianni?
What are you saying to the brothers?
I don't know who you're doing.
I hope that Gianni on lieggi stu libru.
Whoever arrives in time!
I'm not sure who's coming in the first place.
I hope you guys will call as soon as possible.
If you close or don't close, you don't leave me alone.
What did I say, virile?
What a beautiful library!
. . .
I'm overwhelmed by whoever comes in tomorrow.
But you're all cooks.
You call whoever you want.
You're the one who's got the coke.
I'm going to meet you and talk to you this morning.
You've got to be impressed when Mario arrives.

My brothers didn't call the musicians, and the party was boring.
I'm going to wear more curly tomorrow.
It's not like the visas came out all of a sudden.
It's all gone.
Never ask a lady who cleans the stairs.
But if you tell me who I know brothers is good.
I touched him.
Duddu wash them flat.
That picture is already on it.
Don't think about it.
Whoever writes a letter protests.
They're avids, run away.
I said if.
Haven't you checked in yet?
When Mariu leaves, tell me who calls.
The hope is that Mariu will arrive on time.
Be careful.
Either way you want to learn history, you don't know.
On the non-fucking dummies.
As soon as I called you, you got it.
What's up with you?
You make me own malice, u compitu!
Kill him!
Twenty-three.
You're about it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Mancu u vidu.
- You tell me who Mariu didn't come.
But you had to talk to your aunt. You had to talk to her.
Let's go.
What happened to this story?
I didn't see you down, and I didn't see you down.
You get it.
Add a little bit of sugar and a little bit of pure sugar.
Don't run away!
That's about who the dummiest bites from the faces.
Put the washers on the floor.
A roast chicken, a roast apple!
You never eat much in your life.
All the blacks are gone.
George's a whisperer.
I'm in a seat.
I sent them to the post.
It was a pleasure to see you.
Can you find a carusu that the Russian capiddi?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't want to whip or bread.
Whoever brings quaccadunu, lock the door.
Tell me what you're saying.
You didn't talk to us and you let us know what it was.
No, no, no, no.
Unto him who is not subdued, and who is dumani.
You won't find a postman.
If you told your aunt, it wouldn't be a problem.
The stitch's squeezed.
Maria scrissi na littra.
I don't want you to be fools!
I cusiu u buttuni na camisa.
I can't wait for you tomorrow.
Everyone's welcome.
I saw a dog lately.
Let it go tomorrow.
I saw them all.
None of them will be scattered or studied.
What's going on?
If I heard the sound, I'd take him home.
I sent Mario to namicu miu.
-A ciudire!
Invitammu Maria to a party.
You're not going to the lawyer.
After the postman delivered the package, Mario arrived.
You know what's to be done.
Anybody help me!
Come and eat them.
Why are you having a party?
Old Daddy ate me as a soup.
Yesterday he laid a libu to.
You'll be eight years old in Rome.
How much money do you have?
I'm sorry.

. . .
. . .
. . .
Gunnillu!
Don't worry, it won't happen.
I'm going to pass those who used to work well.
I don't like you.
Sit down!
When you say I'm going to get a little worried.
You'll drop the baddies on the ground!
If you like it, try it.
Whoever's named Mario, he felt me.

I'm not sure who's winning it is but niputi.
It's Piero who won't leave.
You need to talk naked now.
You didn't have to go naked!
I hope you guys come.
If I gave Giorgio macari, I'd put him on the table.
. . .
We're going to come to meet you!
The idea of who's dishonest isn't new.
You know who you call is important.
I'm sure we got Giorgio.

There's no wine.
You'll be very tired.
You're never cured.
When I got to Grandma, it's quiet at home.
Jiddu wins.
Whoever comes to Grandma, they're all on vacation.
For those who used to say good things.
There's no nude on the floor.
About who called me a dad.
Iddu used to talk about tias.
I'm going to Castelletto.
What are you talking about?
There's breadsticks.
What happened?
He said to him that he was naked.
If you brothers come or don't come, you others love to leave.
Chiamau so maritu.
You win?
You can't do that.
You want a miracle to make sure that Gianni's a smoker.
On who Gianni sleeps.
Did Mario beat you and accuse you of being a priest?

More than a week.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

. . .
I hope he'll be there in time.
What did I do?
Shussu, you've arrived in time.
. . .
. . .
. . .

Talk to Stefania!
Let me write you to the lawyer.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
- "Cry, pruopriu!
But you're not closing it!
. . .
. . .
