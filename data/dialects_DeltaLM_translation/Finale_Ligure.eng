I had eaten a lot of turta, o Gianni, o if you hear me
I saw her yesterday.
He must give you a book.
I've seen a few nice beds.
I've been talking to you all the time.

When Mary saw them, they were all uncontrollable.

It was a joke.
I've had the opportunity to talk to you.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

They've been waiting for three hours.
And he believed the puree.
I've never had a cushion. I've never had a pillow.

And he introduced you to U Sorsu
I've never heard it in the morning.
And he believed it to be puree, and sent it to him.

And he sent a book to him.

I don't know who's gonna wash the washings.
Matettu u eat a meira
A woman who cleans and scores like a marotta.
I ate it to him.
What's wrong with you, too?
If you said "cushion"
He went to eat in the hosteria.
I don't know if you say you're sleeping
Maria, you're cuddling in Naples.
Who's eating chips and chips?
Furlu, you eat so much, you're so thin.
I thought I saw you yesterday when you left.
I don't know cuss and faces and Gianni
Tell her to feed Mary.
A nue mangia moi frutta, cuella suena
What a woman you've seen yesterday.
I'm not, but I'm not, I'm not.
Tell me who's the most successful.
I've eaten it a lot.
Tell me who's coming tonight
Do you like or don't you like?
You've got to do the same thing.
No one understands me.
I've got a night, I've got a country.
Why do you take me de meire?
Dime dunde u l'è andreu u Sorsu
Women's boxes?

I eat and drink and I'm happy
U u lesi e rilesi de cuntinuu
Did he kill the fai?
Who's gonna eat it?
Where are you going?
You eat and drink every day

You're the one who's got theungu.

A little cu agge criun curcun
Cu me giute, pe piaxei
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Whatever you say to Mariu, you can't believe it.
In any case, you can solve the problem and you don't have any interest.
I don't know who's talking to Mary.
I don't know who follows Arivun
I'm naked, I'm dundee, I'm dundee, I'm dundee.
I don't know what to do with the baby's seat.
I don't know what's going on.
What's going on with Giani?
Who's going to have it?
Believe me that you've put a sheet of paper.
And I hope U Jan read this book.
I hope you'll come back in time
You believed that he would return to the tent.
And I hope that you'll be able to do it.

What's wrong with you?
What a nice book you gave me.

I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think
But you who's who, you're purified, you get everything.
What's up with you?
You're the one who hath made you a condom.
The Mariu who came to you yesterday, he's gone.
I don't know if u Mariu u segge rivun
To the day when a man will come

In the direction of the rebound
The weed has grown out of it
The borca l'è endea a fundu (fondu)in pochi menuti
It's fun in the cinema.
Where's Arvin?
He always grew up well.
The turta a l'è has fermented well
You've got to go too.
I was a friend yesterday and this morning, and I was back to grandma.
In the shadow of the mountain u g'est rivun pe-uprimmu u Sorsu
I have to talk to you in the morning.
When I talked to you, you had to have a big one.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
He's grown so tired.
A l'è vegnua sulu a meistra
There's a cuppu in the back of the head
I'm a little tired.
You've changed so much in your years.
I've spoken too much to seed all in you.
He's even come to him.

It's not the same.
I'm too vague with the other people?
Riva un matettu

On the riva u pustin
I'm not going to know
You're not leaving, you're not leaving.

Anyone will telephone to the prophecy
Duman's doors
I don't know who
Who's asleep?
River Cuarcun
Is Tognu coming?
Incò u riva u Gian
I've come to you yesterday, I've come to you
He's gone.
I don't need to put anything on it.
Don't get into it!
And I hope that someone comes.
If he went also u Sorsu to sarescimu a postu
If you come, or if you come, or if you go,
And even your friends.
The idea that each one of us is naked is new.
