If you tell me that you're studying, you're willing to go to school.

Don't invite Giorgio and Franco to dinner, but pattiru.

Vulia's friends are coming.
Whoever closes the door.
I'll ask you for a little Mary.
Tell them they're capable.
Tell those who were not seen naked.
I know who everyone will pass the test.
They were capable of failing.
If you're hungry, eat.
It's boring.
I feel like you're sitting on comfortable seats.
You'll have to find people who will listen to you.

I'm up on apple pickers.
Don't be mad.
I know brothers find out.
Chiamaru to Vincenzu.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Three years out of many.
I'll call Vincenzo.
All of them.
I wish they had a good time.
He was not promoted as a naked man.
Samaru Mariu at school.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Call a relative.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

He liked them all.

The woman who cleans the stairs is sick.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Maria, you can go to Naples.
. . .
Harry, those who eat a lot, they're too thin to eat.
I've seen you before, you know.
. . .
. . .

This lady was auntie.
You don't see me naked

My mother's milk is good.
When you get to Grandma's house, you'll have to go to tavula.
Let's hope we're done with it without anyone getting tired.
Just back up, lock the door.
Yuva, eat meat.
Alberto got him.
Iddu, make noise.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
I wish that quaccunu would be alive.
Livvu ca nuddu vinissi.
Tell me it was Daddu.
I'm convinced that Mariu's studying is a big deal.
Guess who called Gianni.
. . .
I know who you're crying for.
I know who cries.
Accunu, help me more!
When I said that, don't get into situations.
I don't know who said Mariu, he didn't want to cry.
. . .
I don't know if they were talking to Maria.
I don't know when they came.
I don't know what I'm talking about, but my mom's got the whiskers.
I don't know who gave me dinner.
I don't know what it's like to catch up with meatballs.
What did I say, Gianni?
What are you saying to the brothers?
Tell me what you're gonna do.
I hope Gianni's got it.
They're coming in time!
I'm sure you'll get there in the first place.
I hope you'll call or call as soon as possible.
Open it or not, you don't do it.
Are you a virgin?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
. . .
Whoever comes tomorrow's upset me.
Go on, go on, go on.
You call whoever you want.
You're the one who's got the coke.
Mario, who did you see, did it this morning.
I know when Mariu came.

If you don't call the musicians, the party was boring.
I'm going to get a little more fucked-up tomorrow.
It's not like you're seeing people coming in suddenly.
It's been a long time.
Call the woman who cleans the stairs.
But if you tell me who I know brothers is good.
I touched him.
Duddu wash the dishes.
You already got this picture.
I don't think about it.
Whoever wrote a letter protests.
As soon as you see it, run away.
I thought about it.
Haven't you checked in yet?
Before Mario leaves, say the phone numbers.
The hope that Mario will come sooner or later.
Objects with vessels
Either way you want to solve this problem, you'll have to transfer it to me.
On the non-fucking dummies.
I called you, I called you.
What's wrong with you?
You make me own malice, u compitu!
Kill him!
Don't make mistakes.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't see it.
Tell me who Mariu won't come.
But you had to talk to your aunt. You had to talk to her.
A littra's got a mannata subbitu.
I don't know anything about this.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You get it.
The priests used the sugars as well as the ends.
Don't run away!
I don't want to have more faces.
Duddu wash the dishes.
Whoever apples, a roast chicken is eaten!
No one in life I know never ate truffles.
All the blacks are gone.
George's a whisperer.
More of a seat.
I thought you'd send me more mail.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Can you find a carusu that the Russian capiddi?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I burned bread.
Just back up, lock the door.
Call me my cousin.
Don't talk.
Shooting or shoveling!
Don't take them out of the way.
You won't find a postman.
If you gave it to your aunt, you wouldn't have had a problem.
The stitch's squeezed.
Roma si scriviu na littra.
I don't want you to be fools!
I'll take you on a walk.
I can't do it tomorrow.
You're all dead.
I saw a dog lately.
It's not like it's been a long time.
I saw them all.
None of them will be scattered or studied.
What do you mean?
If I heard the sound, I'd take it home.
You introduced Mario to namicu.
Don't tell her!
Invite Maria to a party.
You're not going to the lawyer.
I'm here. I'm here.
I know what needs to be done as soon as possible.
I need you to help me!
Come and eat chips.
Why are you having a party?
It's soup, but I'll eat it all.
Yesterday you laid a lipstick.
You're eight years old in Rome.
How many refills you've got!
I'm sorry.

Jaddu was moving!
He had no directions!
You're in a subdued laughter.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Damn it!
Don't worry, it won't happen.
It worked fine.
I don't really like it.
- Shut up!
When you say I'm sleeping, he's a little worried.
I'd like you to give me a pint!
I like it very much.
When Mariu came in, he felt like he was on.

I'm not sure who's winning it is but niputi.
It's Piero who won't leave.
You didn't have naked ears.
Why don't you go naked!
Wait for him to come.
I was macari Giorgio, fussimu a puostu.
. . .
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
The fact that quaccunu is dishonest is not new.
You know who you call is important.
I'm sure Giorgio's there.

It's not there.
I'm very tired.
You're never cured.
When I got to Grandma, it's quiet at home.
Jiddu wins.
When Grandma arrives, they're all on vacation.
I know who ever talked well about Tia.
There's no nude on the floor.
I'm the one who calls your parents.
Iddu was talking about tia.
I'm in Castelletto.
A latru was a latru!
There's breadsticks.
What happened?
- You didn't speak naked.
If you come or don't come, brothers, you must leave.
Aarau so maritu.
You win?
You can't do that.
If you want a miracle, hit Gianni with a fume.
It's a little squeaky.
You know, Mario, you've been accused of being a priest?

He died last week.
More than a week.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Hope he'll be there in time.
Cattiu?
If you'd come in time!
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I don't know who's closing the door.
Isn't there a closet?
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Tell Stefania!
Write it to the lawyer.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Don't scream at me!
You're not closing it!
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
