Merchants increased their prices.
I'll take care of all the senses.
The precious trees
Don't talk to me in secret
Quinn de pueilu measures well
Who's the one who's eating you?
They leave a lot of purity.
I'm sorry.
I don't smoke cigarettes on those shelves.
And he's got the flat.
I'm always late.
And women who pass by and walk away

If you talk too much, the other people talk too little.
The books that he commanded me to read.
Sheets and sheets
To the figgi who sempre studiano i van vuentea a scoa
And I don't have any fruit and I know.
I take away the mangiu and the candy.
George and Franco who saw me invited the party
He was robbed in the square.
You're old?
Who are you inviting?
What about the fans?
Have you seen him?
I've been eating the meatballs all night?
Who are you?
An robò?
Everyone talks about it.
It's been a long time now that I've been working on it.
All if you think you did it.
But he asked me to go to Mary.
Believe me I'm not good.
But dizan that nu segge sto ustu nisciun
They thought the aid passed all the exams.
I thought who knew what he was doing.
Issu that if he ate the eaters

I present you to George.
It's going to be a long time before it's done.
Give me a little duman purity
One day in this day
If you follow this warning

I'd like you to talk to me.
What's wrong with you and giant boxes?
You can talk to me there.
The sun sat down.
He assested you
He sat down.
I'm so sorry.
You're asseté
And he's always in the mirror
I regassu con l'aria duman u se ciamma Mariu
No one's mixing!
If Mario is present, he shall be subject to a directive.

In the direction of the gold
The grass grows wrong.
The boat is drowning in a few minutes
It's a good movie.
There's a lesson.
He's grown up all the time
Turta a s'è leà ben
. . .
My friend went to bed and this morning he told his grandmother.
There's air pou firstmu Giorgio
San Giorgio u me o parlà duman matin
I'm sorry, but I know you've made a big one.
Telephones or telephones, you'll have to go to robba the next day.
It's been a while.
It's not going to happen in time.
That shelter has grown so much this year
It's a master.
There's a tail in my head
Aestra astrata
The vitta has been scangià in these years
But when he talked too much, he put all the people in trouble.
I've got a hip in the atru.
There's a sign.
It's a time.
to amigu pa cu sege tantou cuntentu
There's no way you can get the phone out of there.
And Giorgiu's been talking to me, too.
There was no one.
What's going on with me?
Air in the back
It's on the shelf
Aria u pustin
I know.
I'm leaving and I'm leaving.
I searched for him later.
I searched for a telephony at the front door.
Maria a part duman
There's no such thing.
Who sleeps with Gianni?
Air quarchedun
Ne anca u Tunin?
Was it Gianni?
I'm not. I'm not.
It's a Pieru who's naked or left
I don't think he talked to me.
What's going on?
Furu that ena quarchedun
Indesse anca u Giorgiu saescimu a postu
C'a ena or ca nu ena niatri devimu partì
C'ena anca u ostru amigu

When the sun comes down
v'a posciuu parlà d'arescusu
A pouscuu airà puprimmu
I'll be late.
It started from rumma
Sammu's in the car.
Who's Ariò?
Where'd you go?
Where'd Dunde go?
I'll go with you in time.
What's going on?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm not talking to him.

I'm in a little bit of attention to those points.
. . .
. . .
