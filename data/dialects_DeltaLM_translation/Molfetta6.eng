It's cool, it looks like he's studying, he's going to school.
. . .
. . .
Giorgi and Freng, I'm going to hang out tonight, he's leaving.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I don't know what I'm doing.
It's all over the place.
Did you say Marij addo and sciaut?
I don't know what I can do.
He didn't say no, and he was just sitting there.
I think it's all gone and gone.
I think she's less of a fauw.
I don't know how long it'll take.
A book about writing and noise.
I'm going to go somewhere near the committee.
Three hours waiting for you.

Honey, honey, honey.

Your brother's gonna swear everything.
He didn't call V'nginz'.
He didn't whistle at the door.
On the axle
And he's called Vnginz.
Oh, it's all over.
I don't know how to deal with it.
He didn't say it, and he was promoted.
He didn't go to school in Marj.
Don't tell me what I'm doing.
There's no lowr in there.
. . .

Marij, you can't go, you're in Nep'l.
. . .
Don't talk to me, and you're a technician.
I don't know what's going on.
. . .
. . .
. . .
Where's he got air, and he's gone.
No one's seen me.

My own self and my own bounties
When grandma comes, she'll make the bowl.
I'm sure he's done his work without anybody sweating.
After a while, I bought her.
Marj always had a lot of eyes.
Albert's skiing boots
Whoa, whoa.
I don't know what's new.
He had something to do.
There's nothing in there.
I think it's late.
Marj's got a problem.
What's going on with Giann?
. . .
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why didn't he say something?
Anything I can help you with.
When he told me what he didn't know.
Whatever Marj's got to say, don't give it a shit.
. . .
I don't know what Marij talked about.
You know what?
She took her own and caught the fjaur.
He knew what he was doing. He caught me.
It's enough to do it and somebody can go skiing in what's up.
I'll see you.
Do you think you've got a brother?
I hope you don't give up.
It's like Gianni's sleeping book.
I'd say I'd never come back.
I think someone's been in trouble.
I'm sure that's why he's calling me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Did you do the right thing?
What a great book he gave me!
. . .
I'm going to start with what's going on.
But taw ca ste ddo, put it there.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Janj, you've got to get out of here.
I think Marj's gone.

My brother killed the musician, the party broke down.
I don't know what's going on.
Marij's gone all over the place.
Tight and pers orama
I'm calling you a girl. I'm calling you a girl.
I don't think he's a good brother.
I got it.
He washed the flat.
That's the way it's done.
Not a penny.
Maybe someone wrote a few protest letters.
When he saw it, he ran away.
He said he was healthy.
Isn't he angry?
It's not like Marj's got a phone.
I'm afraid Marj's coming to us.
Cheers to you.
No matter how the manager wants to solve this problem, he's not transferring.
I don't know what I'm saying.
As soon as I know he called, he's been subbed.
Who knows or talks?
It's not like it's just meat or something.
Wow!
I don't know what you're saying, and I know what you're doing.
I'll take you to Akkja.
A cherra di nei u so vvist' cchiaw
No, no, no.
Marj's life isn't coming
If you had talked to me about it, I would have understood everything.
The bed's less subtle.
Anybody slept naked there or what?
He didn't see me, and he didn't feel it.
I don't know where he's going.
I burned the sugar, and I don't know what happened to it.
He didn't get away from me!
It's not like it's a big deal.
He didn't wash the floor.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not going to go to life. I'm not going to go.
I saw the whole maker.
Giorgia's going to get the hell out of her.
It's a long shot.
I don't know your manname p'ppost.
You'll like it and you'll like it
What's wrong with the Russians?
It's not like I'm a professor.
I'm going to squeeze the pen.
After a while, I bought her.
Tell me what you want.
It was discussed, but Cure died.
Pay attention to your gratitude!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Look at me.
If anyone had a disability, he had a problem.
He gave me the shit.
Marij wrote about it.
I don't know.
It's like a Kamisa's whip-up.
U mid'k, you're brought up.
I've seen everything.
I know it's naked.
Let's read the cra.
I know everything.
It's not like it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
Did you remember reading the letter?
He's sold you, he's got me anyway.
I'm sorry, Marj.
No, no, no, no!
I'm not going to the party.
Look at your lawyer.
After the postin's got a bag, Marj's gone.
That's what the blood does.
I need some help!
Come on.
How are you doing at the party?
And a few years later, I'll see you.

Whoever believed in a monkey in Rome
What the hell did he do?
Shut up.

Janj's got a ski lift from a manager!
It's been a long time. It's been a long time.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

Decitangiw!
He didn't care, he didn't die there.
He knew that everything was fine.
I didn't like it at all
No, no, no!
I mean, it looks like the throat cares about it.
She's got a tear!
That's why I like it.
When Ma left Marj, I know if she went alone.

I don't know what's going on.
- No, no, no, no.
I've never had anything to say.
That's what I'm talking about.
Maybe someone comes.
You know, George, you're not alone.
. . .
There's no fear.
It's been a long time, and it's been a long time.
I've done it and I'm boring you.
Who cares, and he's scared of George.

Don't you mind.
Tell me thank you, you had a very good time.
Neither day nor night.
My grandmother, the case, and the eyes are thin.
Everybody's got it.
When grandma comes, she's all in the van.
I think someone talked about technology.
You're not even in the middle of it.
Watch your phone.
Everyone talked about technology.
I'll give it to Giorgio and give it to Castelletto.
It's a cat, it's not a cat.
It's beeping.
She killed her sister.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
He called it a Marai.
He's got snow?
Gianni's got a taste.
I don't know. I don't know.
Don't let it go.
P'rcie Marj's got any subtleties?

She's leaving from na s'men.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I'm sure he's got it.
What's going on?
He's got a throat!
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I don't know what's going on.
Did he have a squeak?

Stop Stefanj!
Just write to your lawyer.
. . .
. . .

In the cret!
No, no, no, no.
