It's freeing him up and getting on the train.
. . .
It's a good thing, Sturian, I went to school.
. . .
. . .
Giorgi and Ciccioli, you're gonna be kidding me.
. . .
. . .
. . .

Avess said there's no friend.
It's like it's locked.
When she joined him, she died.
It's a good thing it's a good thing.
She's never seen anyone before.
I think he's been through the night.
Thank you very much.
You don't have any fame eating there.
He'll tell me what he's writing.
Looks like he's following the song.
Three hours to wait.

There's a little bit of honey.
I don't know what it's like.
My brother's got it all up.
He called Vicienz.
Knock it at the door, hang it up.
It's a lot of it.
She was born unborn, the year was called Vicienz.
Booth dropped it all.
It's not like she's sleeping.
It's not like I've been promoted.
He went to school to Mari.
It's a good song.
Come and call me.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
It's all right.
. . .
. . .
. . .
No one's ever seen such a beautiful house.

The female is sick.

. . .
. . .
Maria, you can't get out of here, you've got to go to Naples.
. . .
Bully eats a lot, and he's a thin tea drinker.
I'll create a place where you can see if you know it.
. . .

The lady I saw yesterday, she was old.
No one ever saw me.

It's my mother's mother, her own mother.
Just go home, grandmother, prepare the soup.
I'd like to work all day without anyone getting hurt.
If you find someone, close the door.
Marii's feeding is very low.
The arrow caught L'bert.
No one makes noise.
I thought Mommy was snowing.
Bless that someone made a living.
There was no snow.
N' pinzamm ca facemm tard.
Booth thinks Maria's got a little tired.
He was telling me that Giann had called.
. . .
It looks like an av alluccat nisciun.
Looks like someone's got it.
Help me, please.
When he got this, he got out of it.
He'll say he'll say Mari, now he'll think.
. . .
You know what he talked to Maria.
I'll tell you who needs it.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's why you've been screwing me.
Who knows he got Gianni?
What's wrong with you brother?
Don't tell me you're doing it.
I'm afraid Giuvanna reads this lip.
I thought I'd come back.
I'll wait for someone to come by.
Maybe priest's calling me.
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
Recall the truth.
What a nice book he gave me.
. . .
It's all over the place.
But you're here, you're all right.
It's dark.
Don't tell me anything.
It's all over the air. It's all over the morning.
He'll tell her that Mari's gone.

When his brother called them, the party was over.
He thought I'd take him to school.
Sarah's gonna see it all when she gets to the house at Lassacres.
It's all right.
I'll call the girl who's cleaning up.
My mother looks like a good brother.
M'agg' accattat.
Caciun washed them flat.
It's already hot.
She doesn't mind.
Looks like it's written in print.
If you've seen her, you're right down.
He thought so.
He's angry.
When Mari leaves, she leaves.
Arrives priest ca n'luam lu p'nzier.
It's a vest.
When you go, you'll solve this problem.
Get out of here.
When I called you, he ran away.
You want to riscit?
He made his own mistake in the fight.
Shut up.
That's right, but wrong place.
It's a circus.
I'm going to do it. I'm gonna do it.
He's still eating there.
He went back to Mariuzziell when he came.
If she had talked to me, she'd understand.
It's been a long time.
Chaciun had no idea about his history.
Someone saw it, and no one saw it.
I don't understand myself.
It's got sugar in it, and it's got sugar in it.
Let's calm down.
I don't have a rush on your face.
Liciun lavat li piatt.
It's like an apple, she's ain't ain't ain't ain't.
He gave life to soya that he never ate.
He's seen all the creatures.
Giorgia, you're going to lay down.
It's not a seat.
I've got the adda in the mail.
But I don't think he's gonna like it.
Isn't he a Russian?
He advised me to go to the prophecy.
It's a pig.
Come back, close the door.
Call me a cat.
That's right. He's got to know himself.
Thought he'd be gracious.
It's not a big deal, but it's a big deal.
Go and go.
Whoever turns it over, I don't have a problem.
Cut me out of my hand.
That's what he wrote in the book.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's what's going on on the walk.
He brought you a cram.
Look at everything.
That's where you saw the dog.
Now it's a man's day.
He saw it all the time.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's been a long time.
He kept them sold and got me in the house.
Add Mari to a friend.
I don't know.
Thank you to Mary at the party.
I'm going to call the lawyer.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's what it's all about.
Somebody help me!
Go and eat it.
What's going on at the party?
My mother's eating me out later.
He'll be happy to have your lips.
Quinn was eight years old, I was in Rome.
What the hell did you do?
Get dressed.

Someone's moving.
The whiskey's rising to the east to the east.
Fless ca t'ni squirm.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Get back there.
No preoccupation, nothing happened.
I mean, everything worked fine.
That's all I've heard.
It's safe.
Well, it looks like the sister's feelings aren't good.
That's the winery.
Next time, I liked her.
Maybe Mari's got a feeling she's been singing to me alone.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Let's go.
That's what happened to him.
I'm afraid someone comes.
Giorg died, I'll be back.
. . .
Then he came back to the house.
It's not like I'm new.
He didn't call me anyway.
Booth's sure he's got a mind for George.

That's a goose.
When he fell asleep on his bed, he had a pretty tight fit.
He's never going to run.
When my grandmother's gone, the house's gone.
But neia vnut nisciun.
When my mother-in-law was gone, I was on my vacation.
Looks like someone talked about good tea.
You're not running away.
He was pinching her that her father had called.
Caciun talked about tea.
I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying.
If he was the thief, he was not the thief!
You're over there.
What happened?
He never talked to anyone.
If he doesn't come, he loves her.
Marit called.
What's going on?
Jenn said yes.
Jenn Giann's not smoking, she's going to die.
Jenn's got it.
Why would Mary sleep in a priest's bed?
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
She never could have been there.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
It's not like it's been a year.
He didn't know about it on Saturday.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
It's just coming.
He's already done that.
She's gone there too.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I didn't know it was closed.
No, sit down.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

I'm at St. Stephan's.
He wrote to the lawyer.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Don't believe it!
It never goes down.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
He was waiting, then he went to bed.

Talk to me, Mr. Anthony.
I'm going to go.
. . .
. . .
