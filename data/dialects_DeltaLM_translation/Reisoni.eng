Buttege an aumentou i prezi
And he turned all the senses on you.
The prezi sun cresciu tantou
M'an duvuu parlà in segretotu
The creddu de pueitu mescuà ben
Who's eating them?
They leave a lot of purity.
I'm unemployed.
And I smoke a lot of hot cigarettes.
They're cool and lavian the flats.
It's always late.
And women who cleanse and scavenger go away
. . .
You talk too much, and you talk too little.
The books you had ordered did not come to you.
Sheets and sheets
To the guys who always study the van vuentea at scoa
I don't cattan ever de fruit and me know
And he fixed the mangiu and the candy.
Henry and Francis who saw him invited to the meeting.
l'an roubou u quaddru
You're drinking vans?
Who are you inviting?
Are you kidding the fans?
Have you seen him?
They eat figs in soup?
Who are you?
l'an roubou
Everyone talks about it.
You've seen me?
They thought it was ciuvuu.
I m'an dumandou dunde Maria l'e andera
Believe me I don't have a seat.
You know that no one has seen it.
They thought that everyone had passed the exam.
Susu that saievan in graddu de falu
Issu who ate and was hungry.

You hurt me all.
I've eaten too much turta and I've felt it.
The view of you
He has to give you those books.
I've seen few good pillows
I went to your master and talked to him about you.
The Mariu u ma vistu in ciassa
And I had a father in my heart, and I had a father in my heart
I can't sleep tonight.
Have you seen her?
He's seen it from that post.
But you've got two answers.
I've never seen Mario before.
I'm in you, I'm out of sight
I'm going to present you to George.
You've got to hold your heads.
Mariu u ga posciuu dà a nutisia
You've eaten too many treats.
Whoever has seen it will all come to mind
I've been here since Christmas.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don Giorgio must see duman
It must be purified.
N'a vusciuu makes a joke
If you have not seen it, you have heard it, you have heard it.
I'm going to follow you.
You see well.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll give you the purity I need
I've got my hands full of shoes.
He thinks of purity away
He heard it in the theatre.
I present you to George.
In the case of three countries,
Giorgiu believed de pueime agiotà
Avei ditu questu duveiva ese proprio Aragiou
Whoever comes here sees subbetu
Here you are presenting us to George.
I've been purified in the morning
Postal credits
I saw him too.
I'll give you a little purity.
He puts him in front of him
He's got to ask twice
You present yourself to George.
I've been waiting for you to stay at home.
Give me a little duman purity
I saw him in the daytime
Who follows de pueili will warn
It's thepuscuu of
He believed it was pure.
Giorgiu o l'è segù de pueive mandate u library
A nu has vusciuu from that post or the ruinou
He thinks he can keep purity from man.
Giorgiu l'è segiu de vueigelu purità le u figio a scoa
An vusciuu vedde
And what do you eat?
Who darkened him?
I know who'll wash the dishes.
And he gave me a half.
A woman who cleans and shaves like a marotta.
I was halfway through.
What's going on?
You say it's a cushion
I'm not the guest.
I don't know if you're sleeping.
Mary, you're sleeping in Napulia.
Who's eating potatoes?
You eat so much, you're thin.
He looked at the way he saw it, and he left.
I know what's wrong with Gianni
Tell me what to eat to Mary.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
The squirrel that's hit you, it's me.
You've never seen me.
Tell me who's in charge.
Chaciun l'a mangiou a menestra
Tell me who's coming tonight
Do you grab it or do you just grab it?
I always adopted you to the machine.
Someone understands me.
I sun nascu chi, cunuscu ben u payse
Don't touch meat.
Dime dunde l'é andou Giorgiu
Cosse femmu oua?
Cosa fe oua?
I don't know what you're doing.
He's got it.
No mangemmu mai de fruit
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

Where are you going?
You eat and drink every day
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
He is faithful and always refers to him
You're the one who always holds it.
Come on, look at you?
Accatemmu?
Dunde's been eating you.
Who brings bread?
Who's roubou?
Dunde u l'a missu?
I read and read again and again my book.
The man who cleanses and cleanses is Marottu
Amenestra che a fa a to mumma a l'è proprio bunna
Mumma's grandmother, I've prepared it for you.
I'm not tired of ends.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Don't let Mariu eat de ciù
Consequently, it is not clear whether Alberto is a member of the family.
I'm not gonna let anyone fail.
I told him to come to Mumma with new things.
I'm not sure if I'm alive
I was afraid he'd never come back.
I thought it was late.
I cunvintu that Mariu la studiou pocu
Dudu that agge telefunou Gianni
After you wrote an anonymous letter to him
At what nu agge sbrogiou nisciun
When the eagle sbrogiou quarchedun
I'm looking for someone to help me in squares
Whoever u l'agge ditu questu u nu cunusceiva a situasiun
What do you think?
If we do not find a way to solve this problem, we are not interested.
I know who agge parlou cun Maria
I know who sows arive
I don't know if Mommy's agge hatched the flowers.
I know things to mom.
I know dunde quarchedun u posse truvà quarcose de megiu
What's going on with Gianni?
Do you want the airplane to send them to freight?
Tell me what you're doing.
I hope that u Gianni will read this book.
Veru c'ariviemmu in tempu
They believed that it would come to pass in time.
I hope that the telephony's at the top.
New or old women a walk
What's going on with you?
What a nice book you gave me.
