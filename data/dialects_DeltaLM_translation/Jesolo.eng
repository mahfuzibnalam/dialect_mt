Does he ever read books?
Have you seen your uncle?
What aeo fat?
He's got it.
What did you do?
I don't give you the tomato?
He leze e el rileze sempre il stesso libro
Eat and drink to be happy
It leaks and lifts it continuously.
What did I do?
Do you know he's got a cake?
Where are you putting it?
He feeds you and drinks you all day
Who's got all the book that was here?
If you don't want to leave
Doing and doing the same job?
If you're buying all the time

If you want Mom to be connected with other/others/others
I'm not sure if someone was alive.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He thought it was late.
I'm convinced that Mario is going to study little.
He thinks he'll open up Gianni
Looks like someone wrote an anonymous letter.
Until it's apia zigà lisiun
Before a zigà opens.
Chachedun me jute, par piazer!
And it's not like it's a situation.
Whatever you buy Mario, you don't have to believe it.
In any way el diretor el voje risolva questo problem no ne interessa
I don't know who talks to Mary.
I don't know who it is.
I don't know where that mama a apia buys flowers
I don't know what's going to buy parzena.
I don't know where anybody can find calcosa de mejo
What did you say, Gianni?
Where were you ever messing with the book to brother?
Holden, you think you've got fleas.
I hope Gianni's reading this book.
Hope they'll be back in time.
He thinks someone will come back in time
I hope he'll come back soon.
Whether it rains or doesn't rain
Did you tell me the truth?
That's a nice book that'll make me happy.
You think he said that, Giorgio?
I think it's a lie, I'm upset.
But if you're here, you'll see it all.
Do whatever you want.
If you know it'll cost you something to tell
Mario, who you met yesterday, left this morning.
I've got the impression that Mario is coming back.
He said that Mario won't die.

It's not coming back.
What are you talking about?
Get a tosatel.
There's a tosatel.
Revia el postin
He'll be sober.
In front of me went a man, and in front of me went a man.
Anyone who is late.
Chachedun teaphones to the teacher
Aside from tomorrow
There's no one here
Where Giorgio sleeps
In a few days
What's up with Antonio?
Someone shoreline Gainni
The tosatel who went yesterday, it's me.
It's Piero who won't leave.
It's just that I don't speak.
Why don't you come inside nissun!
I hope some of them come.
Give him his chest if he'll be okay.
Do not come or do not come if you have to leave
'l vegne anca el vostro amico
The idea that someone is dishonest is new.
The fact that he could teefonar is important.
I'm sure it's Giorgio.

He sings and sings all nights

He's coming back late.
He left from Rome.
I'm in the machine.
Who's coming back?
Where are you ndat?
Where'd I go?
Hope he'll be back in time
Where did he go?
He'll come back in time!

Rain.
I have to go.
It doesn't rain.
If you have to come back late
Where's he going?
And if he had been more careful, he wouldn't be here.
