I smoke a lot of fancy cigarettes.
The lavenders, the lavenders.
It's always late.
And women who clean and clean the sun go away
. . .
You're too much and you're talking too much.
The books that you have ordered are onu
The house and the fogs
You like people who always study in scooter.
I don't catan ever fruit and me
The boys eat candy.
Henry and Francis, who had been invited to the seat by his party,
in lan rubou u quadru
Dundi van?
Why do you invite him?
Excuse the fans?
Did you see him?
They're feeding the boys?
Who's coming?
I robbed him.
Everyone talks about it.
I saw that the vuscans came to me.
I thought it would work.
I asked Mary to go to the land.
I don't think they think a ga frasa.
I don't know who's seen it.
I think that everyone's going to pass the exam.
Sunsu that seescinu in grado de falu
I hope they eat if they are hungry.
What's new?
Me pa cuesta carega a scia comuda
It is the three countries that have a record.

Everybody moves

Ce vegiu nusciu
Who vagu ancami cun luatri?
I see a boy.
A ship in the fleet
On the riva u pustin
You don't care if
Other parts of the world
I've been chasing a shore later.
Researched a professional telephony
Maria to go duman
I don't know who
Who's asleep?
Ven quarchedun
What's going on with Antonio?
Ancò u riva Gianni
Fante culè veganiu vei el'è me nevu
There's Piero when you leave.
It's all theirs.
When no one comes in
I hope that some of us
Even Giorgio's seat is in order.
Whatever or whoever goes
U vegna poura u vostru amigu
The idea of someone coming out disunust to a new
The fact de pouei telefuna il'è impurtante

Where devu is going?
You've got to be careful about that.

Go on.
