We all think it was late.
We're convinced that Mariu studied picnics.
I think Gianni called.
. . .
I think he didn't rewrite the cedars.
You think he's drawn up a quarchedunu.
Chachedunu cu me iuta, please.
. . .
Whatever's done by Mariu, it doesn't touch her cunt or cry.
. . .
That's why he talked to Mary.

It's been a few years now that I've been carrying out the correction.
When the Mary has seen it, all the men of the house have come to the house.
. . .
I'm calling you a Christian to clean the stairs.
Mom always tells me that phrase is 'ngarbatu'.
I'll call you back.
Ceddri washed the dishes.
You already have this picture.
He's thinking about it.
I think Quarchedunu wrote a letter of protest.
Everybody's got it.
He's said it himself.
He didn't touch you again.
Go to Mariu's house, talk to him.
The hope that Mariu will return is not comforting.
Cut it out with bubbles.
Whatever the way the director solves this problem, we must not move.
. . .
As soon as I called, you ran away.
- Did you have a disciple?
He made it his own job.
Give it to him!
Admonish her, correct her mistake.
. . .
I don't know what you're saying.
Mancu's dry.
You told him that the Mariu was not.
I'll talk to you, I'll get it.
The letter must have been missing.
Did Archedunu read any subtle history?
Istu ca Cieddri is a mugherita, you know what you're doing.
Even if he doesn't understand the peak.
They thought that the sugar had gone down, and that the sugar had gone down.
Take it easy, I won't run away.

He'd have had to eat the dishes.
It's not like a thousand, it's a chicken that's eaten.
