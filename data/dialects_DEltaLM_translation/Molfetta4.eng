I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That's all he had.
I don't know what I'm saying.
I don't know what I can do.
I don't know if anyone's been seen.
It's all over and over and over.
I think he's got less power to faw.
You know, if he had eaten, he'd keep us fed.
It's a book that's written down.
I mean, who knows what I'm saying?
Three hours waiting for you.

Your brother's gonna kill you all.
Don't call him V'nginz.
He didn't knock at the door.
On the axle
I'm not a writer and I'm a writer.
Oh, it's all over.
I don't know how to deal with it.
I don't know who's been promoted.
She didn't go to school Marj.
Don't tell me I don't know.
I don't know where they're going.

No one's seen me.

I'm a selfish and selfish man.
When grandma came, she bought the table.
I'd say I'd cut off the throat without anyone pulling up.
After a while, I bought her.
You know, Marj's got an eyejaw.
I know where Albert's been.
I've never seen anything like that.
I don't know what's new.
I don't know if anybody's gone.
I don't know what's going on.
I think it's late.
I think Marj's got a headache.
Don't you have a phone, Gianni.
. . .
I don't think anyone's gratified.
What's going on?
Anyone who's done me a favor!
He told me what, and I didn't know what he did.
When he said it, and he said it to Marij, he did not believe it.
. . .
Marij talked to us about it.
I don't know.
It's not like he's got the fjaur.
You know what she's got?
I've got a lot of it and I can buy you something.
What's going on with Gianni?
Did Dado and Ca u have a crush on brotherhood?
P'nzim' ca taw 'ng la putta
Don't let Gianni read your books.
'Cause he's gone.
It's like someone's eyes were shut.
I'll call him when he's upset.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Did Alex tell you the truth?
What a great book he gave me!
. . .
I'm going to tell you what's going on.
But taw ste ddo and put vde everything.
What's going on?
It's a knack of a policeman.
Janj, I don't know what's going on. He's leaving this week.
It was the impression that Marj had arrived.

When a brother didn't call the bar, the party, and he was dead

Marij saw it all in the house at Ambrovvais.
Tight and pers orama
I'll call you in. I'll call you out.
It looks like a good brother to me.
I know it.
He washed the flat.
That's the way it's done.
No one owns it.
I'm sure someone's been writing about it.
There he was, he ran away.
He said hello.
Isn't it the same?
When Marj leaves, he's going to phone.
If Marj's coming soon, we'll be fine.
Ability to exit
I don't know what I'm talking about.
No, no, no, no.
As soon as I know he's called, he won't be surprised.
Do you know what you're saying or what you're saying?
It's not like it's just meat or something.
Wow!
Where I know it, I know it's naked.
Go to Aachjiaw.
I don't know what I'm saying.
No one's eating.
Marj's life isn't coming
If he had talked to me about it, he could have.
The bed's less subtle.
Anybody slept naked there or what?
No one's ever seen me, and no one's ever seen me.
I understand.
I don't know what's going on.
He's not running away from me!
It's not like she's got a big face.
He didn't even wash it.
What's wrong with that?
I'm not going to go to life. I'm not going to go.
I saw the whole maker.
David's on the hook.
It's a long shot.
'I don't know your mannaw' p' post'
You'll like it and you'll like it
Where's the Russian head?
I'm a professor.
I'm going to hang up.
I'll take it back. I'll buy it.
Tell me what you want.
No one talked, no one understood.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I can't just eat it, but I can eat it.
I'll look at you.
If anyone had a thirty-one-year-old daughter, it wasn't a problem for you.
I've been sniffing my legs.
Marij wrote about it.
No, no, no, no, no.
A k'saut u b'tton at the chamber.
U mid'k, you're brought up.
I saw everything.
I know it's naked.
Let's go.
I know everything.
It's a big, big, big, big thing.
Did you remember reading the letter?
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, Marj. I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no!
"Nv'temm' Marij a la festa"
Look at your lawyer.
After he's gone, he's gone Marj.
I don't know what he did to you when his eyes were subtle.
I need some help.
Drink and eat!
How are you doing at the party?
Who's eating my meat later?
Air ha litth nu libr. to
Whoever loves skiing in Rome
What the hell did he do?
Shut up.

It's been a long time. It's been a long time.

Decitangiw!
He didn't care, he didn't die there.
It's clear that all that's left is dry.
I didn't like it at all
No, no, no!
I mean, it looks like the throat cares about it.
You can throw it up!
I don't like the axle.
After Marj left, I know she'll go alone.

It's been a long time now that he hasn't spoken anything.
What's going on?
Maybe someone comes.
It's just George who loves this baby.
. . .
There's no fear.
I'm gonna tell you something and dishonesty, and nothing new.
He made phone calls and loaded them.
Who cares, and he's scared of George.

You're not sure.
It's been a long time.
Neither day nor night.
When grandma came home, her eyes were tight.
Everybody's got it.
After grandma's gone, it's all gone.
I think someone's talked about technology.
You're not even in the middle of it.
Listen to him. He called.
Everyone talked about technology.
Dodo and skiatto, George?
It's not a cat, it's not a cat!
It's beeping.
She killed her sister.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Tratt' ven o nei 'ng' ven, new ama partaj
He called me.
He's got snow?
Gianni's got a taste.
I don't want to kill him.
Gianni can't attack less.

. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

I think he's got a subtle reaction.
What's wrong with him?
Get out of here!
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
No, no, no, no, no.
Did he have a squeak?
