I'm gonna kill my friends.
They thought it was over.
It's been a year since Mary left.
I don't think I'm capable.
I'll tell you what's going on.
I believe that everyone has passed the test.
Itsu ca's in graduate school with a face.
Itsu, eat them if you're hungry.

You cut apples.
There are no children.
Your own brothers found out everything.
They called Vincenzo.
It must be our father.
You're silent.
I was born a little girl named Vincenzu.
Everyone scream.
The bones are treated with bones.
I don't think we're promoting you.
I sent you to Mariu's school.
Look at my beautiful daughters.
You call them a relative.

The soup that you make is very good.
When grandma comes back, prepare the table.
Tell him to break the fence without any squeaking.
We'll close the door.
It's time for Mariu to eat you.
It's up to Alberto.
It's up to us to make noise.
I'm like mommy's cunt.
I'll give you a shout if you do it.
You wanted to have nothing.
We thought it was late.
We're convinced that Mario studied pica.
It looks like Gianni called.
. . .
I think nisciunu crited.
He thinks he cried.
Check me out, please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whatever Mario said, it doesn't touch the cries.
. . .
This sack talked to Maria.
I'll take it back to you.
You've got to be like Mommy's cheating on you.
Mommy gave us dinner.
I don't know what you're saying.
You've never seen the Gianni
Ddune has misu grhu book of the priest.
We think you can do it.
Let Gianni read this book.
I hope you get back in time.
Itsu can't get back in time.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
. . .
Tell you the truth.
What a nice book you gave me.
. . .
Thinking about it upsets me.
But stay here, you can see everything.
Cuiggrhu ca uei.
You don't have to tell me that.
The Mariu met you yesterday, he left this morning.
Add the impression that the Mariu is arriatu.

Even though the frat wanted to call some musicians, the party was boring.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Mary hath told you all thee.
You're all lost by now.
Allow me to call you to clean the stairs.
She always tells me that her sister is good.
You've got me caught.
Wash them and wash the dishes.
This figure is already painted.
I didn't even think about it.
Because quacchetunu wrote a letter protesting.
You spotted him and they ran away.
You said yes.
You still haven't checked it out?
Before Mariu leaves, tell him to call.
The hope that Mariu will give you comfort.
Behave with good instincts.
Whatever way you want to solve your problem, we'll move you out.
Onsu ca crai nu lu portu.
As soon as they're called, they're shot.
What do you care about him?
You've done a very bad job.
Chew it!
By telling him, you're making a mistake.
I've been hanging around with the circle.
The day is not over, and the day is over.
I don't know what's going on.
You told me that Mario's not well.
I've talked to you, I've got it.
The letter must be sent immediately.
Chacchetunu didn't read anything about this.
. . .
But it's a big deal.
Ggrha has squeezed the sugar and added it to it.
Relax, I'm not running away.
Must have slept together with a grey face.
She washed my dishes.
It's a thousand dogs, they've eaten nu roast poultry.
You've never eaten too much in your life.
I'll add all the piss.
It's not like he's eating bread.
Get out of the seat.
You send it to me by mail.
Seeing them was not a pleasure.
You weren't kidding the Russians?
He recommended it to the professor.
Give him the bread.
I closed the door.
Call my niece.
Speaking of it, he understood it anyway.
Watch the stairs.
I can't send him now, but I'll send him.
I'll meet you later.
If you don't know what you're doing, you don't have a problem.
Chinuma cut my hand.
It was written in the letter.
I don't want you to cheat.
Cusuto, put them in the shirt.
I'll take you to the doctor.
I'm all right.
I'll add a dog.
The letter has to be sent early.
It's all right.
Get him to study.
Remembered sites to send you the letter
If you keep them deaf, they'll fall into the house.
Agiu presentatu Mariu a n’ammicu.
I have a big tire.
We invited Maria to the party.
Agiu incontratu l'avvocatu.
After the postman delivered the package, he called Mariu.
I know what he did.
I'm a cowboy.
Come with him and eat.
What did you want for the party?
I made the soup late.
Yesterday I read no book.
When you're eight years old, you go to Rome.
How many gifts he made you
Go get dressed.

Shut him up!
You don't have to worry. Nothing happened.
He thought it worked well.
I liked it.
Takatibu.
She always tells me that her stepmother's awful if she's worried about it.
I don't have a body.
I really like this post.
After he left, I went upstairs.

I'm my nephew.
You're the Pieru who can't let me go.
I can't talk to you.
I don't know what's going on.
It's not like you're going to get away with it.
Without Giorgiu, we could be fine.
. . .
May the friend of yours be put to death!

You're sure Giorgiu's gone.

You guys came.
If you've slept so long, you've got to be very careful.
Ggrrhu never shoots.
After grandma came back, the house's closed.
He didn't have a baby.
After grandma laughed, we all went on vacation.
Looks like he talked to you very well.
There's no bridge to the floor.
I'm glad your father called.
Asciunu talked to you.
Give it to Giorgiu, give it to Castelletto.
Other ca non musci, non thief era.
You don't have breadsticks.
It's already happened?
He hasn't talked to you since.
None or no good brothers must leave.
I called Maritusa.
Did you have a bbinutu?
Gianni got you in.
'Cause Gianni doesn't smoke, it takes no miracle.
You'll see that Gianni's been drinking.
Why did Mariu leave for this?
