You made my friends like it.
I'm closing the door.
I spiaru unni s'inu Maria.
I don't know who you're talking about.
I'll tell you who's naked.
All of you will pass the test.
On those who put the lights.
Whoever comes to eat meat, eat it.
Whoever writes a library, he's a liar.
Sit on comfortable seats.
You've got three hours to watch you.

I'm up on apple pickers.
Don't be mad.
I'm brothers to sgamaru.
Chiamaru to Vincenzu.
Tuppuliaru a potta, have iesiri u daddy.
I'm very upset.
I'll call Vincenzo.
Good morning.
It's good treats.
Arbuddaru to everyone.
Mariu u mannaru to school.
Say it to the men, but fix who on bieddi.
Go call some relatives.

My mother's mother's mother's mother.
Whoever comes to Grandma's, get her to the table.
Let's hope we'll get through it without anyone who's tired.
Whoever comes over, shut the door.
Yuva, eat meat.
Alberto got him.
It's awkward.
I don't know who's coming with us.
I'll tell you who's gonna get alive.
Lvivvu qui non avussu vinutu nudu.
Tell me who daddu was.
Nnu sicuru chi Mariu studiau picca.
Guess who called Gianni.
. . .
I know who you've never been.
I know who this is.
Oh, help me!
Tell me what you're saying, don't think about situations.
If you ask who I said Mariu, it's not to be laughed at.
. . .
That's where they talked to Maria.
I'll take it when it comes.
I suck my mom's ears, I catch my ears.
I'll tell Mommy what's going on tonight.
I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch.
Who did you say Gianni?
What are you saying to the brothers?
It's not sure what's going on.
Tell me who Gianni is on lieggi stu libru.
I hope who arrives on time
I'm sure it's coming in time.
I hope you're being subdued.
Shut it up or not, you're not going to do it.
Could you say it to a man?
Give her a nice libour!
. . .
A pinsieri who hangs out tomorrow in another vote, it's a fool.
You, who you are, a little bit tired.
You call whoever you want.
What are you talking about?
Mario, who are you going to meet this morning?
You've got to be impressed when Mariu arrives.

Seeing who I know of the friars didn't call the musicians, at the party I'd bring my grandmother.
I'm going to wear it tomorrow, and I'm going to wear it tomorrow.
When he saw them all coming in all of a sudden.
Tuttu's on his feet by now.
It's a fifty-five who cleans the stairs.
But if you tell me who I know of the friars, he's a good carusu.
Hit him.
Duddu wash the dishes.
That picture is already on it.
But I don't mind.
I know who wrote the protest letter.
They're avids, run away.
I said if.
Are you still hanging out?
Whoever's got Mariu, tell me who's got my phone number.
The hope that Mariu come to preach to the fosh.
Objects with vessels
If you really want to get rid of this problem, you'll have to transfer it.
Whoever doubts can't do it.
As soon as I call you, I'll come to you.
What's wrong with you?
You've done your own shit!
Eat it!
I told you, na fucking fuck.
He's still biting.
Votes were and weren't closed.
Mancu u vidu.
Tell me who Mariu won't come.
But uncle talked to her, he talked to her.
This girl had a mannari subbitu.
Do you know what this is about?
I've seen that you've seen the muggers, n'a 'spittastuvu chiu.
You don't understand anything.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Come on, don't run!
You had it on your face, little dummy!
Clean the dishes.
An apple is eaten?
I don't know what life's like.
All the blacks are gone.
George's a whisperer.
More of a seat.
I told him who gave it to me.
I'm glad to see you.
Did you see a carusu that the Russian capiddi did?
Cucumannau but figghiu or profissuri.
It's a cake or a bread.
For those of you who've had a bad time, shut your door.
Say hello to my cousin.
Whoever you didn't tell us anything about, you made them understand.
Shooting or shoveling!
You can't wait now. You can't wait now.
Get out of here.
If you don't tell your aunt, it's not a problem.
I cook by hand.
Maria scrissi na littra.
I don't want to fuck you!
I'm cuciu u buttuni na cammisa.
You don't know what you can do tomorrow.
You're all dead.
I saw a dog lately.
A littra loves her mannari dumani.
I saw them all.
I'm not a Christian, but I'm a student.
A mannastuvu a littra?
If I saw the sound, I'd take it home.
I met Mario at a friend's.
He won't tell us!
Tell Mary to come to the party.
I'm not hiring the lawyer.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You know what she loves?
Zaccadunu gave me his hand!
Come in, eat it.
Who are you talking to at a party?
I'm old, but I ate soup.
Yesterday, I was a liar.
I was in Rome eight years ago.
How many reals you've got!
Get out of here.

. . .
. . .
Damn it!
You don't scream, you don't happen.
I'll pass those who worked well.
I don't like you.
Sit down!
If you tell me who I know, he'll be a little worried.
I'll give you a move!
I like you.
I know who's named Mario. I feel good.

I'm not sure who's winning it is but niputi.
Tell Piero who you don't want to leave.
He loves to be all deaf.
You didn't have to go naked!
I hope you guys come.
Giorgio, I'm going to put it up.
. . .
. . .
A pinned who's dishonest isn't new.
The fact that you made who you could call is important.
I'm sure we got Giorgio.

Innu doesn't care.
If anyone accused me so badly, it's probably because he was too tired.
I've never been there.
Whoever came to Grandma, it's quiet at home.
Jiddu wins.
As soon as she gets to Grandma, let's all go on vacation.
For those who used to say good things.
Jiddu's on the floor.
On who your fathers called.
Iddu used to talk about tias.
I'm going to Castelletto.
It was a latrue!
There's breadsticks.
I'm going to kill you.
Aunt, you're gonna be naked.
To the brothers, come or don't come, you're not alone.
Chiamau so maritu.
You win?
Thin skins.
If I wanted a miracle, I called Gianni a smoker.
Gianni tells me who I'm.
You know, Mario, you've been accused of being a priest?

Now tell the lawyer.
. . .

And you know who you're screaming at?
I'll see you now.
