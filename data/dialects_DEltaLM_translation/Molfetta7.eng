If you'd like me to bathe there.
That's all he had.
Mimmat' admanet' Marij addo e sciaut'
I don't know what I can do.
It's all over the place.
It's all gone and gone.
It's a faw's degree.
If you didn't know, you'd never know.
A book that writes and sends.
I don't know what's going on.
Three hours waiting for you.

Brother, I know how to screw it up.
Don't call him V'nginz.
Didn't knock at the door.
On the axle
I'm not a creative person.
Oh, it's all over.
I don't know how to deal with it.
No, no, no, no.
She didn't send Marj to school.
Don't tell me I don't know.
I don't know where they're going.
. . .

Marij, you can't leave, you're in Nep'l.
. . .
It's a big deal, and it's a big deal.
I don't know what's going on.

Mr. Ca's got air, and I'm done.
No one's seen me.

My own self and my own bounties
When grandma comes, she'll make the bowl.
I'm sure she's squished the throat with no stitches.
After a while, I bought her.
Janj has eaten cchjaw'
'Abb's sleep ca u akkatt Albert'
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know what's going on.
Maybe something's been going on.
I liked it when there was nothing.
It was late.
Who cares that Marj's been drinking?
I mean, Gianni called.
. . .
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why don't you go and see if someone's been gratifying?
Anything I can like!
He told me what, and he didn't understand the situation.
Find out what Marj said, and don't believe it.
. . .
I don't know what Marij talked about.
You know what?
It's not like he's got the fjaur.
I'll tell you what's going on tonight.
I've got something I can buy.
You know what Giann told us?
Do you think you've got a brother?
You know what it's like?
I'm afraid Giann's lying in bed.
I'm sure it's a little subtle.
It's a good thing someone's done it.
I hope he called me as soon as possible.
Wherever or wherever you go, you're on your way.
The sack's got it.
What a nice book to give me!
. . .
I'm going to tell you what's going on.
But taw ca ste ddo, there's everything there.
What's going on?
The taw ca stinks out of me.
Janj's got air. He's leaving this morning.
I think Marj's gone.

The party is over, and a brother who has no heart calls the museum.
I'll fix it.
Marij saw it all in the house at Ambrovvais.
Name's not your eyes naked.
I'll call you a girl. I'll call her.
It looks like a good brother to me.
I know it.
He washed the flat.
That's the way it's done.
No one owns it.
I think someone wrote it in the first place.
Once he saw her, she ran away.
He said hello.
Isn't he angry?
When Marj's gone, that's what he did on the phone.
I'm afraid Marj's coming to us.
Get out of here.
No matter what manager wants to solve his problem, he's moving.
I don't know. I don't know.
As soon as I know he's called, he won't be surprised.
Who knows or talks?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Wow!
He was wrong to learn.
He's got to go.
A cherra di nei u so vvist' cchiaw
It's got to be close.
Marj's life isn't coming
If he had talked to me about it, he could have.
The bed's less subtle.
Anyone suffered anything like that?
No one's ever seen me, no one's ever seen me.
What's up?
I don't know what's going on.
He's not running away!
I think it's pretty bad for you.
He washed the flat.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm not going to go to life. I'm not going to go.
I saw the whole maker.
David a pigghja r' ppenna
It's a long shot.
I know it's not the post.
You'll like it and you'll like it
Did you buy me a Russian head?
I've got a girlfriend. I've got a boyfriend.
I'm going to hang up.
After a while, I bought her.
Tell me what you want.
No one tells himself, no one understands himself
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I can't just eat it, but I can eat it.
Look at me.
Even if you had it at age, you didn't have a problem.
Cuffed me tight.
Marij wrote about it.
What's going on?
A k'saut u b'tton Ã  la chemese.
U mid'k, you're brought up.
I've seen everything.
I know it's naked.
Let's go to bed.
I know everything.
It's not like I'm going to do that. It's not like I'm doing that.
Did you remember reading the letter?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Marj a nu k'm begin me
No, no, no, no!
"Nv'temm' Marij a la festa"
Look at your lawyer.
After the postin's got a bag, Marj's gone.
That thing's subb't.
Ajit'm!
Go eat.
How did you see the party?
You'll show me later.
Air has suffered now.
When I get to Rome, it's a monkey.
What the hell did he do?
Shut up.

Janj's getting subtlety from a manager!
I don't know what's going on.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Kill him!
He didn't care, he didn't die there.
But it all worked.
I didn't like it at all
No, no, no!
I mean, it looks like the throat cares about it.
That's a little stainless steel!
That's all I need to do.
After Marj leaves, I know she'll go alone.

I've got no air and no power.
- No, no, no, no.
I don't sleep at all.
What's going on?
I hope he's coming.
If Giorgio had skis, I'd stay.
. . .
There's no fear.
I'm gonna tell you something and dishonesty, and nothing new.
He cut off all the phones and charged.
I'm sure he's scared of George.

I don't know what's going on.
That's why it had less steel in it.
He didn't run away.
Since my grandmother left the house and her eyes were dark.
He hasn't got any.
When grandma comes, she's all in the van.
I think someone's talked about technology.
You're not even in the middle of it.
You know, he just called.
Everyone talked about technology.
Dodo and skiatto, George?
It's a cat, it's not a cat.
It's beeping.
He killed her?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Brother comes or no one comes, new ama partaj
He called me and I wondered.
He's got snow?
Gianni's got a taste.
"I don't want to kill him. I don't want to kill him.
I could have attacked Gianni.
P'rcie Marj's got any subtleties?

It leaves on Saturday.
She's gone.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I'm sure he's got it.
What's wrong with him?
He's got a throat!
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Did he have a squeak?
