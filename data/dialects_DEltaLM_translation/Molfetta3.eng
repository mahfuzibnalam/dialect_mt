I don't have the bathroom.
It's not like he had a job.
I've been looking for it.
I don't know what I'm doing.
It's all over the place.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the exam.
Fitz, I thought he was a faw.
I don't know what you're eating.

Who knows who's saying the waveless abstained comm.

He didn't whistle at the door.
On the axle
He called her Vinginz.
Oh, it's all over.
I don't know what you're saying.
No, no, no, no.
Didn't go to Marj school.
Don't tell me what you're doing.
I don't know where they're going.

My own self and my own bounties
When grandma came, she showed up.
Let's go through the night without anybody stopping.
After a while, I bought her.
He's borrowing from Marj's back.
He fell and attacked Albert.
But I need to have some sort of memory.
I don't know what's new.
I don't know if anybody's gone.
It's not like there's no snow.
I thought it was late.
I think Marj's got a headache.
I mean, Gianni called.
. . .
No, no, no, no, no.
Mm-hmm.
Whatever I want, I like it.
He said that, and he didn't understand the situation.
Anything Marj's got, no sleep.
. . .
I know that's what Marij talked about.
You know what?
It's not like he's got the fjaur.
I don't know what's going on with her.
I thought someone had looked at something meggy.
What did Gianni say?
Do you have a brother's book?
I don't know what you're doing.
It's like Gianni's lying in bed.
I'd like you to come back.
It's like someone's got to come over there.
I'm sure Judd's got a phone, but he can't.
No, no, no, no, no.
What's up with you?
What a nice book to give me!
. . .
I don't know what you're doing.
Taw ca ste do, put it there.
What the fuck?
If you've got something to tell me,
Janj's got air. He's leaving this morning.
I think Marj's gone.

When brother didn't call the musician, the party wasn't good.
Carry-on for correction
Marij's got it. It's all at the brovvais.
T't' e p'rdaut' orama
I'll call you a girl. I'll call her.
It looks like a good brother to me.
I know it.
He washed the flat.
That's the way it's done.
No, no, no, no.
Someone wrote a protest letter.
He didn't like it, he ran away.
He said hello.
Isn't he angry?
When Marj leaves, he calls.
I'm afraid Marj's coming to us.
Weakness in the back
Whichever way the manager wants to solve this problem, he's not transferring.
No, no, no, no.
As soon as I call him, he's got a sudden smile.
Who knows or talks?
If it's a mistake or a mistake.
Wow!
I don't know what you're doing. I know what you're doing.
It's a whirlwind.
I don't know what I'm saying.
No one's eating.
Life of Marj's life
If he had talked to me about it, he could.
The letter has less subtlety.
Anybody slept naked there or what?
No one's ever lived with me, nor has he lived with me.
What's up?
I don't know what's going on.
Shut up, shut up!
It's not like it's a big deal.
He washed the flat.
That's what it's like, it's an awful thing.
I'm not going to go to life. I'm not going to go.
I saw the whole maker.
David a pigghja r' ppenna
It's a long shot.
I know you're a man.
You'll like it and you'll like it
Did you look at the Russian head?
I've got a teacher.
I'm going to hang up.
After a while, I bought her.
Put me on the hook.
No one talked, no one talked.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I don't know. I don't know.
I'll look at you.
I didn't have any problems.
Cuffed me tight.
Marij wrote about it.
No, no, no, no, no.
A k'saut u b'tton Ã  la chemese.
U mid'k, you bring cra.
I saw everything.
I know it's naked.
The letter has less words cra
I know everything.
I just liked it. I just liked it.
Did you read the manna?
If I had the time, I'd be happy anyway.
I'm sorry, Marj. I'm sorry.
None of us!
"Nv'temm' Marij a la festa"
Look at your lawyer.
After he's gone, he's gone Marj.
What's wrong with you?
If someone would help me!
Drink and eat!
How are you doing at the party?
I've been eating my eyes later.
Air ha litth nu libr. to

When Marj's got a job, he's got a manager.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Decitangiw!
You don't care about it. He didn't die there.
It's all over the place.
I didn't like it at all
No, no, no!
It's like the dog's worried about the peak.
There's no chance!
That's all I need to do.
After Marj left, I know she left alone.

- No, no, no, no.
Where you don't bury anything.
I don't know what you're saying.
Maybe someone comes.
He left for George, and he loved him.
. . .
There's no fear.
I'm gonna tell you something and dishonesty and nothing new.
He cut off all the phones and charged.
Who cares, and he's scared of George.

Don't you mind.
As long as it's long as it's long, it's not long.
Neither day nor night.
After he came home, grandma, the house, and the eyes were tight.
Everybody's got it.
When he met his grandmothers, he was all in the van.
I think someone's talked about technology.
You're not even in the middle of it.
What's wrong with you?
Everyone talked about technology.
Dodo and skiatto, George?
It's like a cat, it's not a cat!
It's beeping.
She killed her sister.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Come or don't come, brother, new and leave.
He called me.
He's got snow?
Gianni's got a taste.
P'rcie Marj n fum cchijaw, what happened to me?
For Gianni's assault
P'rcie Marj's got any subtleties?
