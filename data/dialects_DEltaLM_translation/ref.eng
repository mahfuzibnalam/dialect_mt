Merchants have raised prices
The kids looked at each other in the mirror
Prices have risen so much.
They had to talk in secret.
They think they can measure it well.
They wanted to eat here.
They think they can take us away.
They sat down.
They smoke a lot of cigarettes.
The girls will wash the dishes
They are always late.
The women who clean the stairs are gone.
Venezia,Venezia,Veneto
You talk too much and they talk too little.
Of the books you ordered, only three will arrive.
Falling leaves
Your children, who always study, gladly go to school
They never buy fruit, my sisters.
Children eat candy
George and Franco, whom we wanted to invite to dinner, left.
They stole the painting.
Where are they going?
Why won't they invite you?
What do they do?
Did they see you?
Do the kids eat soup?
Are they coming here?
They stole it.
Everybody talks.
I wanted my friends to come.
They thought it was gonna rain.
They asked me where Mary had gone.
They think I'm not capable.
They say no one was seen.
That everyone has passed the exam.
Maybe they could do it.
They'd eat if they were hungry.
The book they write is boring.
These chairs seem very comfortable.
I have three hours to wait for you.
Why do they run like that?
There are a lot of people like that.
The girls we saw yesterday are gone.
The children who came yesterday are my cousins.
They broke it.
The girls made the dishes.
The house your sisters bought was mine.
Tell me what my sisters told you.
The kids took the dishes.
What they were willing to do (to get that seat)!
They responded!
You should see how they treat him.
Who knows when they'll finish their work!
How they behave!
How nice they were!
Now they've moved in!
How many students are taking the exam this time!
I wish they had a big house.
Who knows how much they've earned!
What the hell did they say?
They sounded loud!
How kind they were!
How many have come!
How good they were playing!
You know how many of them fell in there!
Take it, gentlemen.
They can take the others if they want!
They don't want to go.
Since they didn't call, they're not coming.
Don't move out of there!
Why didn't they do it?
Go where they haven't been!
I was waiting for a phone call, and they didn't send me a letter.
Don't move out of there!
Watch the chickens don't go into the garden!
There are few apples.
There's no kids.
His brothers found out.
They called Vincenzo.
It must be our father.
There are a lot of them.
They called him Vincenzo.
They're all here.
I want them to be treated well.
They say no one has been promoted.
They sent Mario to school.
They told my daughters they're beautiful.
They call one of their relatives.
There are few apples.
Pianella,Pescara,Abruzzo
There's your friends.
There are many of them.
We've gone.
They knocked on the door.
Some friends have arrived.
They all read them.
Having eaten too much cake, Gianni felt bad.
I saw her yesterday.
You have to give me that book.
I've seen few houses like this.
Since the teacher only talked to you, she didn't know everything.
She saw me in the square.
With the director making a mistake, we lost time.
You can get it tonight
Did you see her yesterday?
He's sure he wants to give him that place.
He had to receive it.
When no one saw Marco, we didn't wait for him.
Looking in the mirror, she looked old.
I want to introduce you to Giorgio.
You have dyed your hair
Who could tell him the news?
After eating too many strawberries, you're sick today.
Jesus saw them coming home all of a sudden
I want it for Christmas.
I think I can get you tonight.
May I see you tomorrow?
I have to take you home.
He wanted to make a joke.
For not wanting to talk to you right away he missed the opportunity.
I am convinced I can save you.
He could see well.
Gianni seems to have seen everything.
He wants to get you there right away.
I put on my shoes.
I think I can take it away from him.
He could hear it at the theater.
I introduce myself to Giorgio.
They had to bear for three hours.
Who believes he can help me?
When he said that, he was really angry.
I want to see you now.
I want to introduce you to Giorgio.
He was able to bring it in the morning
You think you can send it by mail?
You want to see today?
( From the doctor) He could have brought you back yesterday.
You could put it in front of us (at the stove)
You had to ask twice.
I'll introduce you to Giorgio.
After losing the train, I'm forced to stay at home
You can take it tomorrow.
What you want to see in the day
I'm sure I can warn them.
I could give it to you.
He thinks he can take us home
George's sure he can send you the book.
For not wanting to give him that place, he ruined it.
I think I can take them to the sea tomorrow.
Jesus is sure he wants us to take him to school, the child.
They wanted to see
What do I eat?
Did I forget?
I don't know who'll wash the dishes.
The child eats the apple
The woman who cleans the stairs is sick.
I'm eating apple.
Do I buy bread today?
That's what they say.
Where we eat in the trattoria
It's not like that.
Maria, who you know, is in Naples.
Who eats potatoes?
Robert, who eats a lot, he's thinner than you.
The kid I saw yesterday left.
I don't know what Gianni does.

You never eat fruit, that girl.
The lady you met yesterday is my aunt.
No one saw me.
Tell me who took the picture.

Tell me who's coming tonight
Do you buy it or not?
Always adopt the same car!
No one understands me.
I was born here, I know the country well.
Never buy apples
Tell me where Giorgio went.
What do we do now?
What are you doing now?
You never buy anything.
I got it.
We never eat fruit
I read and read continuously.
You read a history book.
I ate in Florence
Tell me who came.
You never read books.
Have you seen your uncle?
What did he do?
He ate fast.
What did you do?
Don't you eat apples?
Always reads and reads the same book
I eat and drink to be cheerful
He reads and rereads it continuously.
What are you doing?
Who ate the cake?
Where do you put it?
You eat and drink all day
Where did you get the book that was here?
You're the one who won't understand.
And you always do the same job?
You're the one who always buys it.
You're buying it?
What do we buy?
What did you eat?
Who brings bread?
Who stole it?
Who put it?
Always read and read the same book
The man who cleans the stairs is sick.
Your mom's soup is really good.
Before Grandma comes, prepare the table.
We hope to finish the work without anybody getting tired.
Before anyone comes in, we'll close the door.
I think Mario eats more.
I think Alberto buys it.
I know no one makes noise.
We wanted mom to come with us.
I'd like someone to come alive.
You wanted no one to come.
We thought it was too late.
I'm convinced Mario studied little.
I think Gianni called.
Looks like someone wrote an anonymous letter.
Looks like he didn't yell at anyone.
Looks like someone shouted.
Somebody help me, please!
Whoever said that didn't know the situation.
Whatever Mario said, you mustn't believe him.
No matter how the director wants to solve this problem, we don't care.
I don't know who talked to Mary.
I don't know who got here.
I don't know where mom bought the flowers.
I don't know what mom bought for dinner.
I don't know where anyone could find something better.
What did Gianni say, Gianni?
Where did your brother put that book?
We think you can do it.
I hope Gianni reads this book.
I hope we'll be there in time.
Maybe someone will arrive in time.
I hope he'll call as soon as possible.
It rains or not, we'll take a walk.
You think I said the truth?
What a nice book you gave me!
What did I say, Giorgio?
The thought (that) it will arrive tomorrow upsets me
But if you're here, you can see everything.
Do whatever you want.
It's you who has something to tell me.
Mario, who I met yesterday, left this morning.
I have the impression (that) Mario has arrived.
He said (that) Mario won't come

I don't eat meat.
Didn't say goodbye yet?
We never eat fish.

You don't want to see?
Why don't you eat the apple?
It's Franco I didn't want to meet.
Are you buying?
What do you want to see?
Who's taking the package?
Who took it?
Why haven't you been looking for him yet?
You can't find him anywhere.
What guy did you see?
What book have you read?
How many have you seen?
What beautiful shoes you bought!
Sophia's less candy than Mario's.
Make the dishes. Mommy.
Put the dishes in, Dad.
Gianni has more candy than Mario.
Gianni is smarter than you think.
What a great book he wrote!
You know how badly he writes!
"But look why he's not coming! (in the sense of ""He made up a banal excuse for not coming!")"
You should see what he didn't talk about.
Who knows how many people he's told?
Tell me who paid the bill today!
You should see what he was talking about.
Who told you that?
What are you telling me?
How dirty I found him!

You know how he writes badly!
You know what he's been talking about!

You should see what didn't come out.
How many raw apples I found!
You know when he came!
I don't know what you're doing.
You know why he called me!
How much he studies!
He wears expensive clothes!
You know how badly he writes!
You let me down!
If you knew how much it costs!
How much he weighed when he was born!
I wish he'd written badly.
You invited me!
How many articles he's written!
You should see how many people go to those places.
(But look how many he bought!
You know what awful it is!
Take it, Mr. Antonio!
And get your friend too.
Hold on.
The book, John, take it if you want.
Drink a lot if you don't want to get sick!
Always remember to close the door.
Do it yourself.
You do it today.
Give him an answer.
Take the right.
Wash it, ma'am!
(The secretary to the chief) Sign this.
Read it.
Sign this.
Hold still, I'm tired.

Do you ever see him?
Have you seen anyone?
Let no one look at him!
Is there anything I can do?

No one comes to eat here anymore.
Did he say anything?

I don't expect anyone to come.
I'm not telling you because I don't know.
Just leave the light on so the baby doesn't cry.
I invited my classmates, but no one answered.
Without her brother, the party was boring.
I think I'll take it tomorrow to fix it.
Sarah saw them all coming home all of a sudden.
It's all lost.
I called a woman who cleans the stairs.
My mom always tells me that her brother is good.
I bought it.
No one washed the dishes.
You already have this picture.
I don't even think about it.
Looks like someone wrote a letter of protest.
Tell her, you've run away.
She said yes.
You haven't bought it yet?
Before Mario leaves, tell him to call.
The hope that Mario will arrive soon comforts us.
Get dressed.
Whichever way the director wants to solve this problem, we'll move.
I think I won't bring it tomorrow.
As soon as I call you, you're off right away.
What's on your finger?
You did it badly, the task!
Chew it!
Telling him, I made a mistake.

If my uncle had spoken to you, he would have understood.
The letter must be sent immediately.
Did anyone read anything about this?
When no one saw my wife, you didn't wait for her anymore.
You don't understand much.

He must have slept little to have that face.
No one washed the dishes.
Other than an apple, he ate a roast chicken!
Janni has never eaten too much in his life.
I saw all the kids.
Henry went to get bread.
I broke that chair.
I told you to send it by mail.
Seeing them was a pleasure.
Have you met a child with red hair?
I recommended my son to the professor.
Go get the bread.
Before anyone comes in, we'll close the door.
Tell me your niece.
Speaking of it, you made him understand it anyway.

By telling him, I made a mistake.
You go get the bread.
I recommended my son to the professor.
But if you're here, you can see everything.
If no one had told your aunt, we wouldn't have this problem.

You must leave now.
The country where we first met is called Mirano.
Vienna, where we first met, is beautiful.
The town where we met is called Castellino.
Wake up early in the morning.
Stand up!
Come on, hurry!
Don't bother her, I'm recommending!
Don't bother, Mr. Antonio!
I'm not leaving for any reason.
You don't have to worry about anything.
Get him!
Don't worry, nothing happened.
It seemed to me that everything was working well.
I didn't like everything.
Sit down!
She always says her stepmother's worried a little.
If he had an accident!
I really like this place.
After Mario left, I felt lonely.
We're all born the same.
Yesterday came late.
My children's friend's name is Maria.
On Sunday we get up late.

The tree grew wrong.
The boat drowned in a few minutes
The movie was fun.

The cake is well fermented.
You must come too.
Your friend went home yesterday, and your grandmother came this morning.

Where Gianni sleeps
Someone?
Is Antonio coming too?
Gianni comes.
The child who came yesterday is my nephew
It's Piero who won't leave.
It's just that no one talks.
Don't let anyone come in!
I hope someone comes.
If Giorgio was there, we'd be fine.
Come or don't come, we have to leave.
Come with your friend too.
The idea (that) someone is dishonest is not new.
The fact (that) he could call is important
I'm sure Giorgio has gone.
Looks like Piero's gonna be here tomorrow.
Maybe you're wrong!
You, who are a good kid, answer the teacher.
No student came.

I don't want anyone to come!
There's no wine.
After he slept so long, he must have been really tired.

There's little bread.
What happened?
No one talked to you.
Your brother comes or doesn't come, we have to go.
Your husband called.
Who came?
Gianni was able to get out.
If Gianni doesn't smoke anymore, it takes a miracle.
Gianni may have been out.
Why did Mario leave so early?
He promised that (he, that is, Mario) would come.
He promised that (someone else) would come.
Since then, Grandpa has not heard us well since that ear.
This house is mine.
Your brother comes or doesn't come, we have to leave.
If Gianni doesn't smoke anymore, it takes a miracle.
I wanted to.

Nothing could change his mind.

I left a week ago.
It's been a week.
I wanted to go alone.
You could have talked secretly.

I'm late.
He left from Rome.
We went to the car.
Who's here?
Where did you go?
Where did he go?
I hope I got there in time.
Where did he go?
He was on time!
He didn't jump out!
"Who didn't go to that party!
That jumped out!
Some customers came in today!
Who you couldn't talk to?
What things you couldn't do?
I went out not with Maria, but with Piero.
We didn't go because we thought it'd rain.
Haven't you been there again?
Where have you gone?
Did you go?
If it doesn't rain, will you come to us?
Always come late.
You're not coming?
Tell me why you guys want to leave.
Why don't you come?
Take it easy.
Always go straight.
Turn left.
Then don't go!
Don't talk!
You want to talk tomorrow?

Who has to call during the day
What are you doing?
Tell me!
Tell me.
But talk to him!
Do it today.
Do it now.
Don't call her too often!
No phones?
Let's talk to Stefania!
We'll write to the lawyer.
Tell me why you're leaving tomorrow.
Which one do you like more?
We don't call her too often!
Which one you don't like?
You can't believe it!
I'm never going back.
I don't even think about it.
I'll never go back.
And he's always coming.
Are you going or not going?
Rain.
Let's go.
It doesn't rain anymore.
You don't have to be late.
Where am I going?
If he had been more careful, he wouldn't be at this point.
Why do we have to leave so early?
Why do I have to go there?
Do we have to go now?
Why don't you come?
Don't talk!
Leave
Sleeping
I'm going home.
Who's coming in for you?
Who's crying over there?
Right now?
Let's go now?
Where are we going?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Why are you running like that?
Why don't you eat?
You're good!
You're so beautiful!
But look how it runs!
"What kind of people he works with!"
Slowly walk!
You walk slow!
How high it is!
How smart he is!
That's high!
It's not cold here.
You're not coming?
You don't work here anymore?
Are you coming tonight?
Where are you going?
How elegant!
She'll be beautiful!
