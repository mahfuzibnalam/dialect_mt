All of them.
I want you to have a good time.

My mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother.
Whoever comes to grandma, get ready to go.
We hope that whoever ends up in trouble without whoever is not tired
Whoever calls himself quaccadunu, lock him up.
They're awful, they're awful.

Tell me who's whispering
I don't know who's coming with me.
I wish you had a good time.
Lvivvu qui non avussu vinutu nudu.
Tell me who daddu was.
On who Mariu didn't study proopria.
I know who Gianni called.

For those who don't know
I'm like you're a coward.
What's going on?
I said kistu, you don't know who to say.
You know who I said Mariu, he didn't have to cry.
. . .
I know who talked to Mary.
I'll take it when it comes.
I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know.
I don't know who I've got for dinner tonight.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Who did you say Gianni?
But who's sending the book to the brothers?
We'll tell you what you're doing.
I hope that Gianni will take your liberty.
Tell me who's coming in time!
I'll tell you who's coming in the spring.
Tell me who's calling first.
Whoever closes or doesn't close, you don't have to do it.
What did you say?
You've got a beautiful limb!
. . .
The pinsiere who's coming tomorrow, I'm freaking out.
Since it's you, you're all cooked.
Do what you want.
You're the one who's got the hang of feeding me.
Mario, ask who you're going to meet this morning.
Pass when Mariu arrives.

I don't know how to call the musicians at a party.
It's not like you can't do it tomorrow.
When the visas came all in suddenly
There's no lights
I called someone who cleans the stairs.
But mom, tell me who's good.
Hit him.
Duddu wash them flat.
- You've already got this flute.
But don't think about pruopria.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
They're avids, run away.
I thought about it.
Why didn't you even catch him?
Tell me who's calling me.
With the hope that Mariu is a priest, he comforts us.
Objects with vessels
Whatever way you want to solve this problem, you don't have to worry about it.
You can't be dumb bitches.
As soon as I called you,
Who did you call no there?
Why did you do your homework?
Chew him!
I'll get outta here.
He's still biting.
I don't see you.
You haven't seen him?
Tell me who Mariu won't come.
But you have spoken to your mother, and you have spoken to your mother, and you have spoken to your mother, and you have spoken to your mother (all the bones).
A littra had to turn around immediately.
Do you know anything about this?
You know who's seen the muggers, but no one's seen the Tuv.
I capimu piccaredda.
As it ends up with sugar in it, it's just a little.
Inquillu, don't tell me!
I don't want to talk to you. I want to talk to you. I want to talk to you.
Put the washers on the floor.
Who's got a pumu, who's got a roast chicken?
In my life I've never eaten so much.
All the blacks are gone.
George's on a cake or a sandwich.
More of a seat.
I told him who had more mail.
Each one of the vistos was a pleasurable (minus mine).
Can you find a carusu that the Russian capiddi?
Cucumannu a ma figghiu or prufissures.
I don't want to touch or bread.
Whoever calls himself quaccadunu, lock him up.
Oh, my goodness.
Even if you didn't talk to him, you'd make him understand me.
Be careful or steal!
I can't do it today, but I can do it tomorrow.
I'm not gonna go to a portalittra.
When you told your aunt, it's not a problem.
The stitch's squeezed.
Maria scrissi na littra.
I don't want you to be fools!
I've got a cushion and a walker.
You don't know what you can do tomorrow.
All welcome.
I saw a dog lately.
A littra was supposed to leave tomorrow.
I saw them all.
Each one of us is a figghiu, and we're studying.
What do you think of it?
If I heard the sound, I'd take him home.
I asked Mario to come with me.
I don't know!
Invitammu Maria to a party.
You're not going to the lawyer.
After the postman delivered the package, Mario arrived.
You know what happened to him before.
Anybody help me!
Come and eat chips.
Why are you having a party?
It's soup, but I'll eat it all.
Yesterday he laid a libu to.
I was in Rome eight years ago.
How much money do you have?
I'm sorry.

(Sighs) You'll smile immediately.

. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Tell him!
Don't worry, it won't happen.
I don't know who's working very well.
I don't like anything.
Sit down!
If you tell me who I know, he cares a lot.
If you'd come on top of it!
I like you very much.
After Mario was named, I felt hot.

Tell Piero who doesn't want to leave
He didn't speak naked.
I'm sorry, who's not naked!
I hope you come over here.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
. . .
You can tell me to come to your friend!
The idea that quoccadunu is (not) dishonest is not new.
The fact that you made who you could call is important.
I'm sure we got Giorgio.

Innu's not here.
I'll tell you who was tired.
You're never cured.
If you win at Grandma's house, you'll be quiet.
Jiddu wins.
Whoever comes to Grandma, they're all on vacation.
I remember when Quoccadunu talked about you.
Jaddu's on the floor.
I don't know who's calling.
Iddu was talking about tia.
I'm going to Castelletto.
Let it go!
There's no pinch.
What happened?
He didn't tell you anything about you.
If you come or don't come to the brethren, you're not going to have any more to do.
Aarau so maritu.
You win?
You can't do that.
Give Gianni a smoke shut, or else he'll miracle whoever wants.
No, no, no, no.
Why did Mario accuse you of being a priest?
