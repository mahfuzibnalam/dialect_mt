The beetles have already increased the prices.
I don't know. I don't know.
I took the gi-en that grew from there.
They told me a secret.
They think de pudirlu mesuaa ben
Gi-han has eaten chi
They think they could take it away.
I'm unconscious.
If they smoke a lot of cigarettes, those puppets
The phantoms and lavean the waves
The rivan de longu tardi
It's done to spasau, it's done to go.
. . .
You talk too much to yourself while others talk too much.
The books you had urdenà an rivean sulu trei
Creden papers
I'm going to study the long, I'm going to go to school.
A nu catan mai aaa fruta, ee Mei suele
The boys eat candy.
Giorgiu and Francu, who had been invited to Seien, had left.
They've already stolen the quadru.
What's going on?
What's going on with them?
What's the fan?
Have you seen them before?
Eat the fools?
Who wins?
They stole it.
Everyone talks about it.
I'm so glad you came after our friends.
You guys thought you'd be a ciucù.
They've asked me dunde aa Maria a sciaga going
If you believe me and you're good
- disen ch'e nu sciaga vistu nesciun
And you believe that all the sciagans are corrupted
And I thought it was a good idea.
And he thought if he was hungry, he'd eat it.
The library of the writers is new
I think you care so much about it.
It's all you have to do

Jecume Giuani ate them too many turtles if he felt bad
And I saw her.

He's got me in for sure.
He has not seen him, and he has not seen him up there.
Madame, Madame, Madame, Madame.
I wanted to give Georgie a cunt.
What did you say to the sufi?
Liu's got snow.
I've eaten too much meat and you're too bad.
If you've already seen it, you'll find it all in the enpruvisu
And he went to Nadau.

And give George a cunt.

Giorgiu i crede de pudirme agiutaa
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
And I'm going to see you.
And you wanted to give George a cunt.
I could wear it in the morning.
You think I can send it by mail?
I'm going to see
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
When you saw it, you could have put it in front of you.
You've never asked me.
And I gave you a cunt, George.
I have convinced you that I must stay at
I'm wearing a duman.
I'll see you in the day
I'm following you in time.
And I got it.
He thinks he's going to have to put it on.
Giorgiu i-è segù de pudirvi mandaa uu libru
For now he's gone upstairs, he's gone downstairs
I think de pudirmeghe portaa duman a r maa
Giorgiu i gi-è segiu de vurirguu portaa lu, er fante aa schea
They've got up there.
And me, cuse mangiu?
You know why I'm blind?
I don't know who's gonna wash the hands.
The fante eat 'n pumu
I don't know. I don't know.
I've eaten in pumu.
What pan er catu mè, enchè?
If he said
While you're feeding me at the hostaria
I don't know if he's sleeping.
Maia, you're cuddling with your butt, you're in Napulia.
Who's eating potatoes?
Zulu, who eats so much, is down there skinny of you.
The fante that I saw is already gone.
I don't know where the Jews were.
Says she's eating Maia.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
A nu m'ha vistu nesciun
Dime chi-ha piu u quadru

Tell me who wins tonight
You're kidding or you're kidding?
You use the machine for a long time!
A nu me capisce nesciun
Me and I are born who, er pase 'r cunusciu well
You're never gonna fall for it.
Don't tell me what you're saying.
Shut up and faimu aua?
What's wrong with you?
It's not falling.
Then he understood everything.
I don't eat fruit.
Injuries and relapses
L'a lese 'n libru de stoia
Aimu feeds to Firense
I'll tell you who's gone.
And he never read the books.
Did you see that?
What's wrong with you?
He's already eaten.
What's wrong with you?
You're eating pumu?
Illes and I rilese de longu meximu libru
I eat and drink for the rest of the day
I've read and read in every day.
What do you do?
Who's ain't ain't a turtle?
Where are you going?
You eat and drink all day.
Who's who? Who's who? Who's who?
You know what I mean?
What do you do and do long hours of work?
It's a long time.
What's going on?
Aa cateimu?
Who's the one you ate?
Who brings bread?
Who stole it?
You've got it?
Excipients of long-term interest in the European Union
The man who spasa e scae i-è maotu
Aa menestra c'a fa tuu maa a l'è proprio buona
All the way to the nineth, metè n toa
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Good night, I'm in the door.
I'll make sure that Marius eats them after me.
Mia cunvinse Bertu che'i r cata lù
Checheimu de nu faa de'r burdelu
You know so much about it that aa aa aa aa aa aa aa
And you'll see that every one of you lives
I wish you had not come.
And if we thought it was late
And I'm up there that I'm convinced that Mariu's ages will be studied or gnawed.
I've got the telephone.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Aaa, he's happy.
Aaa that quarcun i gi-agia luia
A piaxii, quercun i me vegna n agiutu!
Whoever's already spoken to him, he's all over the place.
I'm a naked girl.
Why don't you have a directive to sbugiaa aamatasa a nuatri i nu fa ni caudu nu freedu
And I don't know what Mary said.
But I don't know who's who.
E n'iu so proprio dunde aa maa a l'ha catà ii fii
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
And not so own dunde quarcun i pudeai truvaa quarcò de megiu
How is it that Gianni has ever told them?
Who knows what you've got?
Trust me and believe me for the duty I give you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
And you think someone's coming back
I'm sure he'll get the phone downstairs.
What's going on or what's going on?
What's wrong with you?
That's a nice libra you gave me.
What did you do, girgiu?
I think it'll be duman's turn on me.
But you know who you could see
Where you come from
T'ei you, you've got it, you've got it, you know?
Liu, who's met him, he's gone.
I've learned that Mariu's going back.
I've already said that Mariu is not coming.

He's seated.

I'll tell you what's going on.
The bush has already grown up.
The boat to it went to sink the little ones.
I'm sure you'll like it.
A gh'è rivà na letea

If you've talked about tea, you've gotta talk about it.
Telephones ain't ain't ain't ain't a thing.
It's all right with me.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'll tell you what you've grown up with.
A l'é vegnù sulu aa maister

It's a windy day.
Every time I-I can't.

Aside from Duman
A nu gh'è nesciun chì
Watch the sleepers.
Quarcun river
You've got a Tognu?
Until and by the Jordan

It's gonna go to the machine.
Who's coming back?
Where'd you go?
Who's going?
