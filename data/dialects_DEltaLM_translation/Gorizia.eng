Mumin tantis (tropis) sigaretis (Spanish), ques frutis!
Les frutis lavaran i plaz
Printin simpri tart
The feminis that netin there scjalis are ladis away
. . .
I fevelis too and lor fevelin too poc
The libris que ve vistu ordenat rivaran dome three
Lisa Lis fueis
You're a flower, you're a student, go to school.
I can't buy it, I can't buy it.
The fruz mangin lis caramelis
Giorgio, Franco that uarevin invid√† a zena son las via
Jan robat the paintings
Over there?
Why don't they envy?
What are you doing?
Who Jan Viodut?
Is the fruz eating the pineapple?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Shevelin duck of chist
Eres volut que vignissin ancia i Mei amis
I thought it was a problem.
Jan asked where Maria was.
Dindin that io no sai bon di fa
Until no one sees it.
That's how you'll get past the test.
I think you weren't boins of falu
I think I'd eat, if I were a fan.
. . .
I par tanta comoitat in chistis ciadreis
You're a three-way man.

Bodies that you see phoned Giani
Where someone sees written an anonymous letter
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chachedun me judi, par plaze.
Whoever saw this thing, didn't know the state.
Whatever you say, Mario, it's no good.
After the director solves this problem, it doesn't interest us.
You don't know who you've been feeding with the Mary.
You don't know where he went.
You don't know where the mother was bought there.
You don't know if stuff your mom bought by her breast
Don't you know there's someone who's gonna buy me some shit?
What's worth saying, Giani?
Where will the books ever stand? Where will the books ever stand?
Din that you could talk.
I hope that Giani she chist books
I hope you'll be back in time
Believe that someone will come back in time
I hope he'll call again.

That's all the books you gave me.
