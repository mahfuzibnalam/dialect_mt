"They're not coming to us.
. . .
You know, those who study, they go to school and like it.
. . .
. . .
I'm invited to hand over Gioggiu and Francu, but I'm in agreement.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I love my friends.
I'll pin down who's who's who.
Maria dumanaru unni avia 'nnatu.
You look like you're not capable.
Someone who hadn't seen himself naked.
Anyone who tests it will all pass.
Enzu, you know what to do.
Whoever's hungry, he's hungry.
I'll let you know who's writing no comments.
I feel like you're sitting in a sunny seat.
You know who you're up to.

It's not like you've got a puma.
It's no good.
I know that the priests scrambled all these things.
Go to Vicenzu.
It's a potèru.
Very sunny years.
I'm not going to do that.
They'll all die.
He gave me good treats.
He who was naked was promoted.
Hararu to Mariu to school.
"And I've got fifty fifty fifty fifty fifty fifty fifty fifty five.
I'm going to scream at your relatives.
. . .
. . .

The girl who cleans the stairs is sick.

Maria, ask who you can't, he's in Naples.

Zulu, if you're a little short, you're a little shorter.
Get out of here.

My mother's milk is too good.
My grandmother used to give me a table.
Give me the finishes, and I'm not tired of it.
When I'm done, I'm done.
Maiu's got eyes on you.
Abbettu's got it.
Duddu have a business.
I thought my mom was coming with us.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You didn't come naked.
I don't know who Daddu was.
I'm convinced that Mariu's got a headache.
I don't know who Gianni called.
. . .
For those who don't make naked boobies.
I know who's here.
Eyes down, more favors!
Whoever said this, he didn't know at all.
You know who I said, I said Mariu.
. . .
Don't talk to Maria.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know if Mommy's mouth's full of chicks.
I'll ask you who's hitting Mom's handcuffs.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What could you call Gianni?
How can you put two books to your brothers?
Tell me who's gonna do it later.
Don't worry if Gianni reads your book.
Call me back in time.
I'll tell you who you've been waiting for in time.
Eru, I'm going to call you all the time.
Be it laughing or not laughing, new years have passed.
Did you tell me the truth?
What a beautiful book you gave me!
. . .
I'm sick.
But, you know, I saw them all like that.
You know who you are.
You know what it's like to fuck me.
Maiu, what you're going to do, you're going to fight this morning.
I think it's Mariu.

I don't know the brothers who didn't play at the party, it was bad.
I don't know who you're talking to.
When they saw everyone at home, they voted.
Arammai tuttu pidutu it.
I told Na fiveina who cleaned the stairs.
My mother tells me you look like who I know brothers is brau.
I'll touch him.
The dishes will be washed.
He's already catching the sniper.
We don't have to worry about it.
Everybody who writes a letter complains to me.
Everybody, get out of here.
I said yes.
What are you talking about?
When I meet Mariu, say I'm calling.
In the early days, Mariu was a long-time fan.
Let's get them dressed.
"In every way and direction you want to overcome this trouble, you don't have to pass it.
Don't worry about it.
As soon as I heard you, you're a fool.
Do you have supra or irritus?
You've done too much harm to him.
Kill them!
You'll tell me.
Yuu mu ceccu.
- No, no, no, no, no.
Mancu 'uvidu.
Tell me why Mariu won't come.
I used to think he was stupid, but now he understands everything.
A littra had a mannari subbitu.
Do you know this story?
I've seen you naked, I've seen you naked, I've seen you naked.
Don't think about it.
When I'm done, I'm on the hook.
See who doesn't run away, calm down!
It's a good thing we're doing this.
Wash the dishes.
Whoever jumps, he'll leave no fried chickens!
This whole life I've never had a lot of hands.
Get rid of all the little pigs.
Today he's going to pick up bread.
More of a seat.
I'm telling you who's in there.
I'll take all the shots.
- You're not going to beat the Russian capiddi?
You'll tell me what you're saying.
You're going to go to parsley or bread.
If you turn me over, you'll see me.
Put me on my cunt.
I don't think so. You'd make us think you're kidding.
Be careful, ladder!
No, no, no, no, no.
"No one's going to find you in the desert.
If you know it, you don't know it.
The crocheted me by hand.
Maria scriìu na littra.
You don't have to take your own!
Get out of here and throw it away.
You may wonder.
Everyone's welcome.
We've seen dogs.
A littra had a nightmare last night.
Kill them all.
Anyone who's caught me, he's making me study.
What's going on with the paperwork?
If I saw him, he'd kill me at home.
I introduced Mario to my friends.
Don't tell us!
"Invitammu Maria to a party.
"I'll find you at the lawyer.
After you've delivered the package, I'm calling Mariu.
I know what was going on.
You help me!
Come on and take it easy.
How do you dress for a party?
I missed the soup.
Yesterday I didn't read you.
Ten years ago I was in Rome.
You're very generous.
Get out of here.

I don't know what you're saying.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Tell him!
Don't worry, it won't happen again.
It's all so good.
I don't like everything.
- Sit down!
When you say it, you look like whoever I know's on the hook. There's tweezers.
Villanova has me!
I like you very much.
After I met Mariu, I felt better.

The one who wins is my nephew.
Pieru who you don't want to talk to.
Jaddu was raving.
Duddu ava trasiri!
Eru, you're gonna come over here.
He'll come to me on Thursday. He'll come to me on Saturday.
. . .
Prepare to come to your friend.
You pinzeri who quacchidunu is dishonest is not new.
Just make sure the phone calls are important.

You didn't have one.
I'll tell you what I'm doing, I'm very tired.
You never heal.
"Whatever I've got from Grandma, she's at home.
Jiddu wins.
Everybody went to grandma, everyone went on vacation.
Whoever's over here, he'll look good.
Iddu's got a layer.
I know who your parents called.
Jaddu's gonna talk to aunt.
At Castillittu annau.
You know what's going on, you know what's going on!
There's a sandwich.
What happened?
"The aunties weren't naked.
My brothers, come or don't come, I love my fathers.
Aarau so maritu.
You win?
It's a big, dark pot.
If Gianni doesn't smoke over there, it'll take a miracle.
It's a big, dark pot.
Did Mariu do this to you?

He was running in the tempu!
. . .

Parramu with Stafania!
Write it to the lawyer.

Don't blame yourself!
You don't look at us.
