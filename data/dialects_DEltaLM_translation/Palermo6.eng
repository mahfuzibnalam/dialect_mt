Everybody creates a cage of screws

I'm like a meatloaf

I don't think I can pass all the exams.
I don't think it's a bad thing.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I like the comfortable sunbeds.

Sit down at the table before Santa arrives
Let me finish it before some dude gets tired.
Tell me before I fall for someone.
David's hands are closed
L’av’a accattari alberto
You've got to make noise
I didn’t like it like my mom.
I wish a few dunes had come alive
Get out of here like a naked grape
I think it was late.
I'm convinced that mario app'a sturiari picca

You're naked, you're blind.
It's like a few dunes were gone.
I can't help you.

I don't know what you're saying.
Have you ever laughed at Gianni?
How can you put yourselves to the brethren of the Bible?
Samsamu ca c’a po fari

We'll get there in time.
Wait a minute, you'll get there.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

You're telling me the truth!
I'll give you a bed of life!

I thought Romanians came to me.

I'm calling some musicians, to festa fu noisa
On top of that, you can be Romanian.
When all the victims came suddenly
It's a dark end.
I'm calling you to clean the stairs.
My mother always lick me, I know brothers he's a good kid
Me l'accattavu
Jaddu cleaned the dishes.
Who's got this fury?
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
They're virists, they're running.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What's going on with you?
Before Maria leaves, call again.
The hope that Mario's coming, makes us feel better.
Clothes heads
.
Romanians a t’u puortu
Whosoever called you, answered you.
Why are you angry?
You did not do any evil.
Mancialu
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm going to go.
I'm not a fisherman. I'm a fisherman.
Cucu u vivo
Recistivu ca Mario un come close
If uncle had seen his aunt, he had seen his head.
A liettera av’a esseri mannata subitu
Is there any history of any of this?
Now that I am naked to you, I am waiting for you.
You get it.
Due to the fact that there is no sugar in it, there is no sugar in it.
Good luck with your escape.
Go to sleep and hit your faces
Naked dishes or naked dishes
Avutru as a punishment, a chicken arustutu
Sonni, n'a so vite un manciò mai assai
Goodbye to all the peckers.
Ludwig of Piggha u pani
I'm not a rumpiu.
I laughed that he was holding me up.
It was such a pleasurable
Would you kill a guy who knew Russians?
He advised me to stick to the cords
I don’t want to cook bread.
It's a long time ago.
Goodbye.
Even if you didn't get it, you'd get it anyway.
A ccura al grarinu
Even Romanians do it, no more maize.
Mucciavu au postinu
Yes, I'd like to talk to you about it.
The cook hand-squeezed me
Maria, I wrote a letter to you.
I want you to be buggers.
Cut and dump the walk.
I don’t know, I don’t know
All victims.
I saw a dog.
A liter of spirit in Romanian
All meals
Each one of us is a fig, or a buckle.
Have you remembered to breathe a litre?
If I saw the little ones, I'd take them home.
I wrote to mario to a friend of mine.
What's up?
I invited Maria to a party.
Go to the lawyer.
Scroppu ca u postini consegnava un paccu, mario arriviò
The cuosa s'av'a fari belle priestu
Somebody help me.
Come on.
How do you feel about the party?
I'm late for soup.
Yesterday I had a limb of yours.
8 years ago in Rome
How many gifts can you give?
Wash it up.

It's worse than a flight.
You've been shaving or you've been shaving naked
You've got to be naked.
I hope some dunu come
If I had been pure Giorgi, I would have put him up.
. . .
Let your friends come to you.
The fact that someone is disonning this is new.
The fact that you fucking callers is disgusting.

Scroppu came to Grandma, at home is quiet
Nud wins
We're all on holiday.
I need some app to make good use of it.
If a layer is nuddu or even the other way around
I mean, he called your fathers.
Dudu, I'll be back.
Donn s inniu Giorgio? S’inniu a Castelletto
