He knew that his friends
When they were hanging over the door
The year after the death of Mary
Why do they think I'm not capable?
They say nothing has ever been seen.
I've passed the exam.
Enzo is capable of re ro
When they were hungry they ate.
A book that they write in front of them.
I think you guys are very comfortable.
I have three hours waiting.

When I know he beats apples
I'm not creatures
The brothers found out everything.
I called Bbicienzo
He's been knocked down.
I think about it very much.
It's named no breeding and the year called Vicienzo
They're all here.
Onion caerule treated bbone
Rhiceno and grandfather has been promoted nisciuno
Give it to Mario at school.
I say to my children that I know not to know
They do not call them relatives.

The minestra ca face mammeta is very good.
When grandma arrives, she equips the towel.
Let's go, king, we'll finish the cake without anybody getting tired.
When the cocchirùni rise and lock the door
Madam, you're gonna eat king eyes.
L'ada accattà Abberto
No one's grieving.
We waited for mom to come naked
If he wanted to show up, he'd show up.
Goodbye to you.
It was already late.
Mary's mother's mother's mother
. . .
. . .
It's not like you've got a niskin.
It's not like the cocchiruno is all over.
If Cocchiruni could help me please
I don't know anything.
I know I'm not gonna believe it.
. . .
I don't know who talked about Mary.
I don't know who's here.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not saying that I could find a better king.
Did you ever talk to Gianni?
Here's my new book.
We told him that he can do it.
I hope Gianna reads this book.
I hope we get to you.
Enzo ca cocehiruno adda arrivà a tempo
Let's hope that the phone's subbit
Key or not key, let's walk.
If he believed the truth
It's a book I've never read.
. . .
If the thought comes to me, stay and make me mad
But you didn't know it.
I want you to like it.
You'd be a cozy girl.

As the friar calls not the musicians, the fairy is flying
Inzo ca te ro porto crai, pe r'acconzà
Mary the Queen comes to the house at the entrance.
It's all lost.
Aage called na femmina a pulizia re grala
Mommy Rice seems like the brother's good.
I'm done.
Non-cooked dishes
You've already got the ferret.
I'm not a penzo.
Because cocchiruno is written in the letter re protests
As you did.
I think so.
He didn't catch it yet.
Before Mario leaves, I call the phone.
Mario will come to us soon.
Ativity
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Roro ca crai no ro porto
That's what I call sites immediately accursi
Why do you care about it?
He did a very bad job!
Eat him!
It's wrong to say
They'll find them.
I swear to you that I'm not a fool.
They weren't missing
You've got to believe that Mario's not a child.
If he had spoken to you, he would have understood.
Letra s'adda manà mò
I don't know what's going on.
As you've waited for her, you've waited.
Now you know what's going on.
As the sugar cane is finished, I don't want to borrow it.
I don't know how to get away from it.
It's rurmuto picca pe tené quera facci
Unwashed dishes
I know that apple, no, this roast has eaten
They return to his life his grandfather has never eaten so much
I've seen all creations
France and Italy
I break that seat
l'aggio ritto re me ro Mannà pe pposta
I'll be glad to hear from you.
A non-productive clash on the Russian capitals
Recommended age to the teacher
Peeled bread sticks
Lock the door first
Goodbye.
I don't know. I don't know.
Agreed to the King.
I can't do it now, and I can do it now.
I hit the postman.
I don't know, but we don't care about this problem.
The cook has given me his hand
Jesus is written in the letter.
I'm not gonna cheat on you.
I cushioned the concrete on the walk.
Stay with me and I'll take it.
Goodbye to all.
I saw no dog.
Let's go.
All viewed
Their son is made big adda sturià
Get out of here, man.
If you keep me deaf, you'll keep me in the house.
Aged represented by Mario a n friend
I don't know.
I invited Maria to the party.
Aged struck the Avocalo
The package arrived pure Mario.
I know what he's doing and before he's king.
I need you to help me.
Come on, I'll take you.
How do you write on Lafesta?
I don't eat soup.
Yesterday your book was read.
Eight years ago we're going to Rome
How much money did he give you?
I'll text you.

Don't worry, nothing happened.
I think everything is good.
I didn't know anything.

I felt lonely when I left.

No one's talking.
I don't know.
Hope ca vene cocchiruno
You're pure Giorgio.
. . .
Just a few wines to your friend
The penziero ca cocchiruno is mariuolo grandmother's new
The fact that he could phone is important.
Don't worry about it.

Nobody's a child.
She doesn't sleep so long because she's really tired.
The dragon never runs.
When grandma came home, the house was over.
There's no baby.
We all go to the sea.
'Cause the crocodile speaks good to you
Half the way there's nothing.
You're the one who's called me.
No one talked to you.
Ado is Giorgio. He helped Castelletto.
Tota ca ata, it was no mariuolo
Ppane is spicy.
What happened?
No one talked to you.
Frozen or not, nui amma part
The telephone call has been made
What's wrong with you?
Janni is gone.
It's no miracle, it doesn't give a smoke to Gianni
Donni could have taken it.
Why did Mario leave at half an hour?
