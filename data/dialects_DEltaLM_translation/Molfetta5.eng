I'll take her to school.

Giorgi and Freng, you've come to the house to eat, he's gone.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
That's all he had.
I don't know what I'm saying.
I don't know what I'm doing.
It's all over the place.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the exam.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what I'm doing.
It's a book that's screaming and screaming.
I mean, I don't know what I'm saying.
Three hours waiting for you.

I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what you're doing.
The brother knows everything.
Don't call him V'nginz.
He didn't whistle at the door.
It's been a long time.
It's not a creation, it's a calling.
Oh, it's all over.
I don't know how to deal with it.
No, no, no, no.
Didn't go to school Marj.
I don't know what it's like.
I don't know where they're going.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

Marij, you can't leave, you're in Nep'l.
. . .
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
The creation of air has begun
. . .
. . .
. . .
Mr. Ca's got air, and he's been waiting for me.
No one's seen me.

My own self and my own bounties
When grandma came, fix the plate.
It's a splash of light, it's a splash of light, it's a splash of light, it's a splash of light.
After a while, I bought her.
But it's necessary for Marj to get out of here.
But you need to catch Albert.
But I need to have some sort of memory.
W'lemm' ca memm' v'nis' c' new
If anybody's gone.
It's been a long time.
I thought it was late.
I think Marj's got a headache.
What's wrong with the phone?
. . .
I'm sure everyone's grateful.
I'm guessing he's been gratifying a little.
Anything I want, please.
He said that, and he didn't understand the situation.
I don't know what Marj's got to say.
. . .
Marij talked to us about it.
You know what?
It's not like he's got the fjaur.
You know what? You know what?
I'll get some of it. I'll get some of it.
You know what Giann told us?
Do you have a brother?
It's not like taw Ng's put it.
I'm going to say that Gianni reads the book.
I'm going to go to sleep.
I was hoping someday he'd come.
Turn the phone off.
Wherever or wherever, new, new, new, new.
What's wrong with you?
That's a nice book.
. . .
I can't wait for you to come back.
But taw ca ste ddo, put it there.
What's going on?
The taw ca thin as a rack'ndarm
Janj, I don't know what's going on. He's leaving this week.
It was the impression that Marj had arrived.

No, no, no.
I don't know what you're doing.
Marij's seen it all red at the Ambrovvais.
Tight and pers orama
It's called a stone-wash girl.
It looks like a good brother to me.
I got it.
He washed the flat.
He's already done his job.
No one owns it.
Guess someone wrote some prowtests.
Ma'am's gone, she's gone.
He said he was healthy.
Isn't he angry?
When Marj leaves, he doesn't have a telephone.
If Marj arrives soon, I'll calm myself down.
Cheers to you.
Anytime a manager wants to solve his problem, he's moving in.
I don't know. I don't know.
As soon as I know he called, he's been subbed.
Who knows or talks?
Mm-hmm. It's just a mistake.
Fuck you!
I know it's wrong.
He's got to go.
I don't know what I'm saying.
He sees closer.
Marj's life isn't coming
If my grandfather had talked about it, he could have subbed.
The bed's less subtle.
Anybody slept naked there or what?
No one's ever seen me, and no one's ever seen me.
What's up?
I don't know what's going on.
That's it, it's gone.
It's a little dark on your face.
He didn't wash the floor.
What's wrong with you?
I'm not going to go to life. I'm not going to go.
I saw the whole thing.
David a pigghja r' ppenna
It's a long shot.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't like it.
What's up with the Russians?
He's got a figghj'm or a professor.
I'm going to hang up.
After a while, I bought her.
Tell me what you want.
No, no, no, no, no.
Attention to or gratitude
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll look at you.
I didn't even know you had it at age, and I didn't have a problem.
I've got my legs tight.
Marij wrote about it.
Don't let it go!
A k'saut u b'tton Ã  la chemese.
U mid'k, you bring cra.
I've seen everything.
I know it's naked.
Let's go to bed.
I know everything.
That's cool. It's all over it.
Did you remember reading the letter?
If I had the money, I'd be fine.
I'm sorry, Marj. I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.
"Nv'temm' Marij a la festa"
Look at your lawyer.
After you've got a packet, Marj's gone.
That's what the blood does.
I need some help!
Moltettiw a moltia
How did you see the party?
Show me my eyes later.
Air ha litth nu libr. to
When he got there, he called to Rome.
What the hell did he do?
Shut up.

- Marj's got to get a submission from the manager!
It's time to go skiing.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Authority!
You don't care about it. He didn't die there.
Looks like everything's working.
I didn't like being naked there.
No, no, no!
Mm, since it seems like the straw is worried about the peak.
I can't get a drop!
I'm sorry.
After Marj left, I know she'll go alone.

I've got no air and no power.
- No, no, no, no.
But I need you to go to the bar.
What's going on?
I hope he's coming.
You know, George, you're not alone.
. . .
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm gonna tell you something and dishonesty and nothing new.
He cut off all the phones and charged.
Who cares, and he's scared of George.

Don't you mind.
That's when he told me he was long, he was shorter.
Neither day nor night.
My grandmother, the house and the eyes were quiet.
Everybody's got it.
My grandmother had kidnapped the grandmothers.
I'm sure someone's got a clue.
You're not even in the middle of it.
What's wrong with this guy's phone?
Everyone talked about technology.
Dodo and skiatto, George?
It's a cat, it's not a cat!
It's beeping.
Did she kill her?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
He called me.
He's got snow?
Gianni's got a taste.
I don't want to talk to him.
Gianni can't attack less.
P'rcie Marj's got any subtleties?

It's been a long time.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
It's not like he's been in the ship.
Did he leave?
Get out of here!
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Did he have a squeak?
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
