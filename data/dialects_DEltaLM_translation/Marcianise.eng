Children who are always in school, they're always going to school.

George and Franco, who had to eat tonight, left.

I thought my comrades were coming.
As long as I thought it was closed.
It's Maria who asked.
They said I don't know how to do it.
They think he hasn't seen anything.
They said everyone passed the test.
I think he's capable of it.
I think they should eat, if they're hungry.
The book they're writing is falling asleep.
Looks like your legs are pretty comfortable.
I've been waiting for you for three hours.

There are a few apples.
There are creatures here.
The brothers up there knew all about it.
You called Vicienzo.
They knocked on the door.
There's a lot left.
They called him Vicienzo.
We're all here.
I want them to be treated well.
They think nisciuno has been promoted.
They missed Mario's school.
They thought my daughters were beautiful.
They call them their relatives.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

I'll read it all.

A femmena who puliz and stairs is sick.

. . .
. . .

Maria, you can't go, she's in Naples.
. . .
Harry, who never eats so much, is closed and you.
The creature I saw yesterday, it's gone.

The lady who was interviewed yesterday, and aunt.
He didn't see me.

Mommy's breastfeeding is really spicy.
When Grandma arrives, get ready to go.
Let's hope, and it ended hard without anyone calming down.
We locked the door.
Maria's a big hunter and a big eater.
If Alberto was going to catch him.
You know, it makes noise.
We've been complaining that Mama's coming with nuts.
He wished I'd go to jail if he was true.
He wanted no one to come.
I thought it was late.
I'm sure Mario hasn't had much trouble.
I think he telephoned Gianni.
. . .
Looks like Nisciuno's been hooked.
Looks like carcun got hooked.
Somebody help me, please!
Whoever thought that didn't know the situation.
Anything Mario can believe.
. . .
I know who talked to Maria.
I don't know who's coming.
Mommy's got the squirrels.
You know what Mummy made for me tonight.
I'm going to give it a little more salt, and the better.
What did Gianni ever get?
What's wrong with you?
We're hoping you're a little late.
I hope Gianni reads your book.
I hope we got there in time.
They're afraid carcuno's coming to Timp.
I hope he calls as soon as possible.
Opens or doesn't opens, we're just walking around.
He believed it to be true?
What a nice book you gave me!
. . .
The thought of you staying scares me.
But you're kidding, you can do all things right.
Do what you want.
You're the one who's caring for me.
The guy you met yesterday, left this morning.
I have the impression that Mario has come.

The party fell asleep.
My purity remains corrected.
Maria, who has seen everyone, will come home in the morning.
It's all lost.
A job called na femmena that cleans and ladders.
Mom always says that a friar is good.
I got it.
Man a lavat e piatto.
He's already holding a figurine.
I don't care.
What carcun wrote the letter and prutest.
You've seen him. You've got to get a hold of him.
She thinks she is.
You still haven't caught it.
Before Mario leaves, he calls and calls.
The shooter that Mario arrives at press makes us quiet.
She went to dress up.
Whatever the manager wants to solve this problem, we're gone.
I think no purity remains.
As soon as I called the site they came right away.
Do you have a cup or a rite?
You gave me this very badly.
Goat!
Tell him the wrong thing.
I'm going to see him.
I didn't see it in the cold.
I miss you.
You thought Mario's coming.
If you were talking to you, you could understand.
You sent me the letter right away.
Did anyone read anything about this?
As niusciuno saw it, you didn't cut it off.
You don't understand much.
As it has burnt or sugar, the tribute is little.
Be quiet, I didn't leave!
He hasn't slept well enough to have that face.
He washed the dishes.
Face and apple, he ate naked roast pudding.
You've never eaten too much in your life.
I've seen all creatures.
Ludwig's at pigs or bread.
I broke the seat.
I'll take the money and send it to the mail.
It was a pleasure to see them.
A red-haired naked creature?
I've recommended my daughter to a professor.
You've got to take a whip or a bread.
After he took the quarcuno, we locked the door.
Call me back.
Don't talk about it. You've done it yourself.
Be careful or step.
I'm going to go now, but I'm going to go tomorrow.
Added or bookcase.
If no one saw it, we wouldn't have a problem.
My brother-in-law twirled my hand.
Maria wrote a letter herself.
I don't want you to do anything!
It's a cozy or a walking button.
I'll take you back.
I've seen how many of them are.
Today I saw a dog.
The letter left behind.
We've all seen each other.
My daughter grows up like a star.
You're all set on a letter start?
If you're blind and deaf, I'd hug you in the house.
He introduced Mario to my friend.
Don't say that.
We invited Maria to the party.
I met the lawyer.
Ropp, the mailbox delivered the packages, Mario came.
You know what's up or down soon.
A carcasses helps me.
Come and eat it.
Do you want to go to party?
I'll take the pills later.
Yesterday he read no of your books.
You keep us in Rome.
How many gifts I've made you.
Go get dressed.

You better get out of here.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .

. . .
. . .

Waitecell.
If you're worried, now nothing's happened.
It felt like everything was working well.
I didn't like everything.
Seize it!
But I always hear that mommy's husband cares little about it.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
I really like this place.
I'm glad Mario left. I felt lonely.

The creature that came yesterday is nephew.
It was Piero who never left.
It's better for anyone to talk.
Why don't you do that!
I hope he'll come over.
If it was Giorgio, we'd be fine.
. . .
Behold, your friend came.
The thought that someone is dishonest, now is a new thing.
The fact that he can call is important.
I'm sure there's some help from Giorgio.

There's a wine.
The guy who slept a long time, he was really relaxed.
Itsu never runs.
I'm sorry she came to grandma's house, it's closed.
No one came.
Arop that's been taken from grandma, we've been away all the time and on vacation.
I think Carcun talked good about you.
He's in the middle of the road.
I hear your father called.
Somebody out there talked about you.
It's helped by Castelletto.
The face of the cow, he was naked!
Bread is little.
Who died?
He didn't talk to you.
Come or don't come friars, but go.
I've called her or her husband.
Who came?
Gianni could go up there.
It was a miracle, Gianni didn't shut up.
Gianni can be dry.
Why did Mario leave so soon?

. . .
. . .
. . .

. . .
. . .

I hope he got there in time.
Fors left?
Yes, I've arrived a time!
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
When we were there, we thought it was closed.
Are these sites closed down?
. . .
. . .
. . .

. . .

Talk to Stefania!
-But write to the lawyer.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Don't believe it!
I never get away from it.
