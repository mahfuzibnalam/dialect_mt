I don't know what I can do.
So rich that you've never seen in a stone.
I'm sure I passed the exam.
You know, she has to do it.
I don't think you're eating in the house.
Whoever writes more than that
Next, I'll start.
I'll be waiting for three hours.

I don't know what it's like.
I don't know. I know.
A brother's (app'rat's) has taken over everything.
He called C'nzin'.
He knocked at the door.
I don't know.
He called her C'nzin.
It's all gone.
It's a good deal.
Looks like no one's been promoting her.
Marij's gone to school.
It's like a beautiful girl.
I'll go down and call his relatives.

M'nestra r' mamata ea probbia buona
When grandma arrives, she's ready for the table.
And give him the fatwa before he's tired
Whoever's gone, he's back at the door.
Marij adda will eat in the eye
He's got Alberto.
I don't know what's going on.
I'll tell you what my mom's doing.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Whoever lives, whoever goes.
Just when it was late.
I'm sure Maria's got a headache.
Mm-hmm.
. . .
Why didn't he lighten up?
I'll send you somewhere.
Somebody help me, please.
Anyone who's heard that, he can't leave the situation.

What's wrong with who talked to Maria?
I don't know who got it.
No, no, no, no.
I don't know he got his mom.
There's no place where anyone can find a cozy meatball
When did you meet Gianni?
Don't avarraj puost quigghj libri, fratta?
I'm sure you'll make it.
Maybe Gianni reads his books.
I'm not going anywhere.
Somebody's gonna get there sooner.
It's gonna be awful sooner or later
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
And he believed the truth?
What a great book.
. . .
I think I'm overwhelmed.
Whoever comes over here, he'll be all right.
What's the job?
Yeah, that's what you're doing.
Mario, whoever's left yesterday, he's leaving tomorrow.
Go to Marij adda it's gone.

The feast was a fly, which a brother in the village called the natures.
I'm sure he'll bring it to me.
Mary's seeing she's coming home at the bridge.
I don't know why.
I'll call you a girl who's on the road.
My mother seems to be a good brother.
He caught the egg.
No one washed them flat.
Figurine jacket already painted
Don't think about it.
Unless anyone wrote in the letter.
As soon as he saw it, he ran away.
He said yes.
Haven't you caught it yet?
No matter who Mari leaves, you'll have to leave the phone.
It's not like Marij's life's been cut off.
What's going on?
That's the manager, I don't know
Carr' ca n' lu port' craj
As soon as you get a call, you'll be stunned.
What's going on with him?
He's a bad guy, he's a bad guy.
Chew it!
It's all right, but it's all right.
I'll go see him.
I don't know. I don't know.
It's not a problem.
He died when Marij came.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean.
And now it's all over the place.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'm not a fly, I'm a fly, I'm a fly.
I don't know anything.
I'm sorry, I don't know.
Stajn's sure he won't get away!
I don't know what I'm talking about.
No one washed them flat.
Ca' ca na m'legghia, s'eia fr'cat' nu poll' arrust'
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Every day, I create them.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a red-and-white thing.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I've seen you like it.
Isn't he still in the Russian head?
I'll take my daughter to my father's house.
Bread rolls
I'll open the door.
Call her.
I'm not talking about it. I'm going to have to do the same.
Be careful with the steps.
I don't know what's going on.
A day away from the throne
I'm just going to get out of here. I'm just going to get out of here.
No, no, no.
Mary's will be there.
I don't want to buy her.
It's a little bit of a walk.
Kraj brings you back on Friday.
All right, look at it.
That's where you saw the naked dog
Let'ra l'hamma mbucà eraj
I've seen it all.
My daughter's gonna be big.
It's all over the place.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Add Marij to a friend.
Don't tell him!
Madam invited Maria to the party.
I'll take the envelope.
Whoever's got a mind, he's got a pact.
You know what you're doing to the ambrosia?
Fuck my hand!
Come on, eat it.
What's going on at the party?
Watch your eyes later.
I've had the pleasure of reading it.
As soon as he was eight, he went to Rome.
Find out who did it!
Here you go.

Don't worry, nothing happens.
I think it's all good.
I didn't like it so much.
State aid
It's not like the sacred is worried about it.
The pozza came to the pant that
I liked this post.
I'm not alone.

Hey, Piero who wants to leave?
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't go back!
Why don't you go there?
I'll see you later.
. . .
I'm not our friend.
And no one's dishonesty is new.
It's a fact that he can't talk to him.
I'm sure you know Giorgio.

I don't love you.
It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's been a long time.
Don't go running.
Whoever's gone to grandma, the house's gone.
It hasn't been consumed in a stone.
Whoever's lost his grandmother, loves it all.
'Cause someone's said good things about you.
No one's breaking the layer.
I think that's what he said.
No one's talkin' about it.
Where's your stunt, Giorgio?
It was ca hat, mariuol was.
I don't want to eat bread.
What if she died?
No one ever told you about it.
He's gone, he's gone.
It's been a long time.
What's going on?
No, no, no, no.
Don't look at me, Gianni.
I don't know what you're saying.
Why is Marij a priest?
