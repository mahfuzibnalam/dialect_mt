She thought she had chjove.
M'han addummanate dova jeva juta Maria.
Believe me I don't know well.
She says she hasn't seen anything.
I think you guys all passed the exam.
Things that were good to do.
They'll eat if they're hungry.
It's boring.
Looks like you've got no comrades.
I've been waiting for you for three hours.

It's just a few apples.
There are no living creatures.
Brother Hanna's got it all covered.
Call her Vincenzo.
They've got them at the door.
I don't care.
It was born new creatures.
You're all sorry.
I want you to be treated well.
You know it hasn't been promoted.
You sent Marie to school.
You know what I'm talking about?
Don't call her a relative.
. . .
You're a little lazy.
. . .
. . .
I'm jute.
You've got it at the door.
And the chickens.

My mother's making meat is very good,
Before Grandma comes, prepare the tavel.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Now that it's racing, shut the door.
Mary's mother of Chiuje.
You've got it, Albè.
Someone's sorry.
Tell me that my mom would tell me that.
It's a shame that a cackhead would keep us alive.
Try not to lie.
We thought it was late.
We're convinced Marie studied little.
He thinks you called Gianni.
. . .
You know, he hasn't had any noise.
Looks like he's got a clue.
If you could help me, please!
Jane, who's got business here, couldn't do it.
These things that Mario said, he can't believe it.
. . .
I don't know who talked to Maria.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know where mom picked up the beans.
The sacks of quidd that mom picked up for dinner.
It's a sack where it's cackled. It's a cackle.
What did you say to Gianni?
Where did you put the brothers' books?
He thinks you're the best.
I hope Gianni reads his books.
I hope he'll come back in time.
He thinks that it's more and more time-consuming.
I hope the phone's closed.
Whether it closes or doesn't close, there's no passing.
Did he tell the truth?
What a beautiful book he gave me!
. . .
The paintings he's gonna have tomorrow shock me.
But you who's here, you can see all of them.
That's what he saw.
Yeah, you're the one who's got me like a coward.
Mary, I'm waiting for you. I'm leaving this morning.
It feels like Marie Jane's here.

Someone washed them flat.
You guys already have this.
I don't mind.
Looks like he's been writing jokes in his letter of protest.
Take care of it.
She said ski.
Didn't you catch it yet?
Before Mario leaves, tell him to call.
The hope that Marie will see the light comforts us.
She went to dress.
If the director is going to solve this problem, he's not going to move.
I don't want to put it away.
As soon as you call me, you're subbed.
What do you know?
He hurt himself, he competes!
Go(s)!
Dinnenelu, you're making mistakes.
Go find him.
You know, you haven't seen them.
He doesn't see it.
Tell them Mario doesn't see.
If they had spoken to you, they would have understood.
The letter's been so subtle.
Have you read this story?
She had no sight of Muggirema, neither did you wait for her.
He understands little.

It's been a while since you had a little sleep.
She didn't wash her flat legs.

Seeing them is a pleasure.
Are you cutting no red-headed beasts?
Recommend it to the head of school.
I'm going to eat the bread.
Now that it's racing, shut the door.
Call me a doggie.
He doesn't talk about it. He made him understand it himself.
Notice the stairs!
Girls don't eat them, but eat them.
You don't have to worry about it.
If anyone had told her, you wouldn't have had a problem.
Cuggineme tightened my hand.
Catherine wrote in the letter.
I don't want to shave you.
You've cut the concrete to your shirt.
I'm a medech. I'm a cra.
You all saw them.
Joje's seen the dog.
The letter has been sent from Jesse.
You've all seen her.

Do you remember when you sent the letter?
If he had the money, he'd take me to the house.
You've made Marie a nu compagne mija.
I don't know.
So let's get Mary to the party.
Cut the screw.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
I wonder what you've got.
If you could help me!

In England there is a sea of beer.
Take them for free.
Calciune has washed the flat
. . .
Why didn't he catch it?
. . .
But how did you get that dark?
If they had spoken to you, they would have understood.
The letter has been sent by Jesse Subbete.
. . .
. . .
Fuck me.
. . .
Jenna, you're great.
. . .
She makes Jotte Anne in Rome.
. . .
Come on.
It's done.

When she saw it, she suddenly came to the house.
Mamamaje tells me he's a good brother.
You can go with the motorcycle.
They're wrong.
Roma a pighjia lo bread.
You're recommended to fuck the professor's ass.

It seemed like everything was working well.
I didn't like them all.
Activate it!
She says it's just that the maddamma's worried about us.
What's going on?
I really like your interviews.
Since I left, Marie, I felt lonely.
She's born in the same place.
I'm sorry.

She's not coming.
She had slept so much, she had her own sleep.
He doesn't run away.
The house is quiet.
It's not weakened.
It's just that grandma's young, she's all on a vacation.
Looks like Cacchedune's been talking good about you.
There's no way out.
He thinks your father made phone calls.
Someone talked about you.
Give it to Castelletto.
